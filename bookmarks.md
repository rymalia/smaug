## @TrungTPhan - How Netflix Changed Filmmaking: Insights from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
> Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on Rogan taking about how Netflix has changed filmmaking.
>
> A major considerations is dealing with distracted viewers. To keep them tuned in, "you re-iterate the plot 3-4x in the dialogue because people are on their phones."
>
> Then, in action films, you change the ordering of climatic fights.
>
> In traditional action films, you'd have "three set pieces" in every act (I, II, III) and each would "ramp up" (spend the big money on third set piece).
>
> But streaming has to hook viewers within 5 minute, so the incentive is to put a major battle or action sequence much earlier.
>
> Also, the directors have less incentive to make a film look great because so many people watch on laptops and phones.
>
> They do say that streaming allows for more bets on risky projects since the theatre economics are geared towards IP, sequels and super-heroes.
>
> Example: an independent film with a $25m budget would spend $25m on marketing (1:1 ratio). But since it splits box office with the theatre, the film needs to make $100m (1/2 of which is $50m) just to break even.
>
> They're realistic about the state of film and call it a supply-demand issue. If the demand is for at-home viewing (eg. Netflix 300m+ subs), then filmmaking approach will change to feed the algo.
>
> When there's demand for theatre, Damon will go team up with Christopher Nolan to make "The Odyssey".

> Agent coding life hack:

Claude Opus 4.5 LOVES it when you ask for its personal opinion on tooling: basically, what it would want if it got to be in charge of making a tool for its own use. 

I'm working on such a tool now for managing processes on a machine (process_triage) and already have a lot fleshed out in a plan document, but decided to ask Claude this:

"OK, without changing the plan document, what do you think would make this project better? What would make it more useful SPECIFICALLY TO YOU if you had to manage one or more linux machines using ssh for optimal performance?  Use ultrathink"

Claude's response is below, but before I paste that whole thing in, here's the next prompt I used to tell it to integrate the suggestions effectively:

"Wonderful. Please carefully make ALL the revisions, additions, expansions, etc. to the document, but in a super cohesive and coherent way, where they are artfully woven into the existing structure and not just dumped into some awful appendix.  Use ultrathink"

PS: Notice how it "desperately want[s]" these feature. Bet you didn't realize your clankers had desires, especially of the "desperate" kind!

## @414magyarbirds - Update from Magyar:
> Update from Magyar:
(On the growth of middle and deep strikes and the slowdown in enemy manpower elimination – the reason and the next move)

The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white in January – it wants to live, even while coming with occupation intentions.

The counter reads: we crossed the 4,200-worm mark over two weeks in January. In 14 days, the USF Birds wiped out the full assault strength of 10 enemy battalions – or the entire infantry of a bit more than three regiments, down to the root. 
That’s not enough, motherfucker. Not enough.

The detox pace is slowed by a third compared to the same period in December – back then, in 14 days, the Birds pecked down over 6,000 carcasses.

The main reason has nothing to do with any drop in the Birds’ combat capability. On the contrary, we’re scaling up – 12,877 enemy targets logged as of the morning of January 15 in the USF Counter. Plenty of fat targets deep in the swamps (already over a hundred), 17 SAM/RADAR units on the air-defense tally, 963 aerial targets (recon wings, Shaheds), 571 enemy pilot launch sites, over 200 guns, 25 SPGs, 42 tanks, 36 AFVs, close to 1,000 units of logistics vehicles, and so on…

But the share of sung-off enemy manpower has dropped. The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white, it’s not switching on Jackie-Chan mode, it weighs every assault, it’s slowed down hard – and that’s noticeable.

On top of that, it’s patching the holes in reinforcements after the December blowout – that was the first time the “arrived/left” balance was confirmed at zero: drones alone pulled 33,000 worms out of the war, exactly as many as the bunker grandpa throws in every month.

In January, that balance will be tougher by about ten thousand, which means more work under pressure in spring. So let’s work, dear Birds, steadily and nonstop, focusing exactly on infantry and worm pilots.

And the oil pour-houses and power sockets in the swamps will keep getting lit in growing numbers – that’s beyond doubt. Together with air defense, of course.

Track the USF results on scoreboard “PIDRAKHUIKA”

## @jaimefjorge - AI-Native Software Engineering and Ralph Loop Insights

> The biggest takeaways/nuggets from my interview with @GeoffreyHuntley on AI-native software engineering and the Ralph loop:
>
> 1. Software development and software engineering are now two different professions, and one of them is over. Software development, the work of translating tickets into code, can now be done by anyone for $10-42/hour while they sleep. Software engineering, architecture, security, requirements breakdown, understanding failure modes, is where humans still matter. If you identify as a "software developer," you're competing against a bash loop. If you identify as a "software engineer," your job is to orchestrate the loops.
>
> 2. The moat you think protects your software product doesn't exist anymore. Geoffrey argues you can clone any SaaS product, even those with BSL licenses or proprietary enterprise code, using AI. He ran Ralph in reverse on HashiCorp Nomad's source code to generate clean-room specifications. When he hit gaps from missing enterprise features, he ran Ralph over their marketing materials and product docs to fill them in. Any company relying on licensing or code secrecy as a competitive moat needs to rethink their strategy.
>
> 3. Cursor, Windsurf, and every other AI coding tool are essentially the same thing: a loop that automatically copies and pastes. Geoffrey built these tools professionally and says the harness does almost nothing; the model does all the work. There's no real moat in the harness business when you're reselling tokens. The only differentiator is taste and UX. Stop evaluating tools and start learning the underlying patterns.
>
> 4. Ralph is not a product. It's an orchestrator pattern for running thousands of AI loops. The simplest version is a bash loop that deterministically allocates memory, lets the LLM pick one task, executes it, then starts fresh. The key insight: every loop gets a brand new context window. You avoid compaction (where the AI gets dumber as context fills up) by never letting the context window accumulate competing goals. Your institutional knowledge lives in specification files, not in the context window.
>
> 5. Specifications are the new source code. Geoffrey's workflow: spend 30 minutes in conversation with AI, drilling into requirements, making engineering decisions, building up specs. Then throw those specs to Ralph and get weeks worth of work in hours. The specs act as a "pin" that reframes every fresh loop with your domain knowledge. He doesn't hand-write specs. He code-generates them through structured conversation. Prototypes are now free. Refactoring is cheap.
>
> 6. The entry-level path into software engineering is closing fast. Geoffrey's company stopped hiring juniors for a year until they figured out how to interview for AI-native skills. There's already a cohort of juniors who've been practicing these techniques for six months. They'll work at a quarter of senior wages and outship them. If you're just picking up these tools today, you're behind. The new interview question: can you explain how to build a coding agent on a whiteboard?
>
> 7. Senior engineers who refuse to adapt are in more danger than juniors who embrace it. Geoffrey sees respected engineers taking hardline stances against AI ("it's installing fascism in your codebase"). Meanwhile, leadership teams are discovering Ralph and realizing three people can run the output of an entire org. When commit velocity and product velocity diverge that dramatically between adopters and non-adopters, founders notice. The hard line is coming.
>
> 8. AI is an amplifier of operator skill, not a replacement for it. If you're great at security and you get good at AI, you become a weapon. If you're mediocre and you use AI, you're still mediocre, just faster. The skill gap comes from "discoveries": learning the tricks, the loop-backs, the ways to close the automation loop. These techniques don't have standardized language yet. We're inventing the terms for the new computer every day.
>
> 9. Open source may no longer make sense for most use cases. Geoffrey, a former prominent open source maintainer whose land was funded by Open Collective, no longer uses open source libraries. His reasoning: every dependency injects a human into the loop. If there's a bug, you open a PR, chase a maintainer, wait. That's not automation. Instead, code-generate what you need. The exception: don't generate cryptography or security-critical code unless you have the domain expertise to verify it.
>
> 10. Programming languages now have a tier list based on how well AI agents can work with them. S-tier: Rust, TypeScript (especially with Effect.js), Python with Pydantic. These are source-based with strong type systems that reject invalid generations and work well with ripgrep for code discovery. F-tier: Java and .NET. Their DLL-based dependency systems don't work natively with the search tools AI agents use. The tradeoff with Rust: compilation is slow, so bad generations cost more time.
>
> 11. Corporate AI transformation programs are dangerously slow. Three-to-four-year rollouts with coaches and committees won't cut it when three founders in Bali can Ralph your entire product and undercut your pricing by 99%. Smaller teams ship faster. By the time the transformation is done, the market has moved. Geoffrey calls this the "Titanic moment": the boat is full, get the next boat.
>
> 12. We have a new computer, and that's why the legends are coming out of retirement. The last 40 years of computing decisions were designed for humans: TTYs, environment variables, slow language evolution to avoid breaking mental models. Now we have robots. What's the bare minimum a robot needs? Geoffrey sees this as the most exciting time in computing. If you're not excited about what you can now build, you haven't truly picked up the new computer yet.

## @frankdilo - Keeping a Work Log with Claude Code Integration
> You should keep a worklog.

A worklog is a record of what you work on day by day. I decided to keep it in the form of one markdown file per day, in a repository, connected to Claude Code. I have been keeping one for the past couple of years.

During the day, I throw stuff at Claude and it translates into nice and tidy bullet points that are human-readable. At the end of the day, I share this on a # progress Slack channel with the team so everyone is up to speed with everyone else.

It keeps you accountable and it's great for keeping track of what you do day to day and week to week and see if it matches your bigger plan.

I also have a /checkpoint command that summarizes my progress since last week and creates a markdown file.

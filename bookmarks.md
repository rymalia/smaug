## @foundmyfitness - APOE and Alzheimer's Disease
> Nearly all Alzheimer's, and half of dementia, is driven by APOE.
>
> A new, large-scale analysis reports that up to 93% of Alzheimer's cases and 85% of brain amyloid burden are attributable to having an APOE ε3/ε4 genotype, and the combined contribution of ε3 and ε4 to all-cause dementia is roughly 46%.
>
> The authors estimate that without the strong underlying risks conferred by APOE ε3 and ε4, almost all Alzheimer's disease and about half of all dementia cases would not occur.
>
> APOE is a risk factor, not an absolute determinant—many people with ε4 never develop Alzheimer's and many without it do. Still, the scale of these estimates makes it clear that APOE biology is a dominant driver of Alzheimer's risk at the population level.

## @louisanicola_ - Alzheimer's is more common than we thought. Blood tests just proved it.
> Alzheimer's is more common than we thought. Blood tests just proved it.
>
> What the science shows
>
> 1. Almost 1 in 10 people over 70 have Alzheimer's dementia
> This comes from a large Norwegian study using blood biomarkers + cognitive testing, not just surveys.
>
> 2. Alzheimer's starts years before symptoms
> About 10% had high pTau217 with no symptoms, meaning preclinical Alzheimer's is already in the brain.
>
> 3. Rates after 85 were way higher than expected
> Around 25% of people aged 85 to 89 had Alzheimer's dementia, far above older estimates.
>
> 4. Blood tests change the picture
> pTau217 in blood tracks amyloid in the brain and reveals cases we used to miss.
>
> 5. Education mattered
> Lower education levels were linked to higher Alzheimer's pathology, even before dementia.
>
> 6. Screening is powerful and risky
> Experts warn blood tests are not ready for mass screening without safeguards.
>
> We now have tools to detect Alzheimer's early, but our healthcare system is built to step in after damage is done. We underfund education, prevention, and brain health, then act shocked when dementia explodes decades later.
>
> If Alzheimer's is showing up in blood years before memory loss, waiting until people forget their names is a policy failure, not a scientific one.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/louisanicola_/status/2009672443271753791
- **What:** Analysis of recent research on Alzheimer's prevalence using blood biomarker testing. Highlights that Alzheimer's is far more common than previously estimated (1 in 10 over 70) and can be detected years before symptoms appear via blood tests like pTau217.

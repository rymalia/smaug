## @PerceptualPeak - Deep Context Injection: Dynamic Context Management Tool
> Good lord. I just built a new context management tool....and WOW. This is beyond useful and solves a major problem we all deal with. I call it "Deep Context Injection".
>
> Imagine being able to pick whatever topic of context you want from all of your past chat sessions, and have it be injected directly in with your prompt before Claude starts iterating? Even better - being able to establish how many tokens of relevant context you want injected?
>
> With my system, you can now do exactly that with a prompt that looks like this:
>
> "I want to add an email feed to my personal dashboard. [CONTEXT: email feed mcp server: 5K] [CONTEXT: adding features to the personal dashboard: 5K]"
>
> That prompt will pull the 5,000 of the most relevant tokens (to each statement in the brackets) from every chat session you've ever had, and inject all of that context to the back end of your prompt before Claude starts iterating.
>
> Whole thing takes 5-8 seconds. Mind-blowing stuff that will forever change how I use Claude Code. Efficiency levels shooting up yet again.
>
> More on this tomorrow.

## @aakashgupta - Van Dongen Sleep Study Deep Dive
> This is one of the most important studies in sleep science. Van Dongen et al. ran the experiment that changed how we understand chronic sleep restriction. They had subjects sleep 4h, 6h, or 8h nightly for 14 days, testing cognitive performance every 2 hours. The 6h group's reaction time deficits by day 14 matched subjects who had been awake for 24 hours straight. The 4h group? They performed like someone awake 48 hours. But here's what makes this study terrifying. The Stanford Sleepiness Scale ratings in Panel B plateau after day 3-4. Subjects stopped feeling more tired even as their cognitive performance continued deteriorating through day 14. Your subjective experience of fatigue is a lagging indicator that eventually just… stops updating. This explains why chronic undersleeping feels sustainable. You've adapted to feeling tired. Your prefrontal cortex hasn't adapted to being impaired. The PVT (Psychomotor Vigilance Task) in Panel A measures lapses in attention. These are the moments where you're staring at a screen and your brain simply checks out for 500ms. Every additional day of 6h sleep adds more lapses. The curve never flattens. Panel C and D show working memory and processing speed. Same pattern: continuous degradation with no subjective awareness. The practical implications: If you're sleeping 6h and think you're functioning fine, you've lost the internal calibration to know you're not. The subjects in this study would have told you they felt "okay" while performing like they'd pulled an all-nighter. For anyone doing cognitively demanding work, this means you cannot trust how you feel. You need to track objective markers: error rates, decision latency, problem-solving throughput. Sleep need is biological, not negotiable. Most adults require 7-9 hours, and the research shows no population-level adaptation to chronic restriction. "I only need 6 hours" is almost always "I've forgotten what baseline cognition feels like."
>
> *Quoting @iiKlemm:* Competitive gamers: 6h of sleep is a hidden nerf. 6h/night for 2 weeks → reaction time & attention decline to the equivalent of pulling MULTIPLE all-nighters. Worst part: subjective fatigue plateaus, so you stop noticing. If you're not getting 7+ hours/night, you're trolling. https://t.co/ZeXAgJeDg2

## @davidsenra - Engineering Excellence Philosophy from Shopify CEO
> "I cannot surround people with things that are underperforming the quality of engineering we want to do."
>
> "The most fundamental design error that you can possibly make is create a falseness in a product that make people predictably do the wrong thing. So I make a big deal out of these kind of things. I cannot surround people with things that are underperforming the quality of engineering we want to do.

## @drwilliamwallac - Muscle Glucose Clearance After Eating
> Your muscles clear glucose in two different ways after a meal.
> Most people only use one.
>
> When you sit after eating, glucose disposal depends almost entirely on insulin signaling from the pancreas. That pathway works, but it has limited capacity, which is why post-meal glucose spikes are higher and longer.
>
> When you move after eating, even lightly, a second pathway turns on in parallel.
>
> Muscle contraction independently activates glucose transporters (GLUT4), allowing glucose to enter muscle without waiting for insulin. The result is faster clearance, lower peaks, and less strain on the pancreas.
>
> What's happening under the hood:
> • Muscle contraction triggers GLUT4 translocation
> • Glucose enters muscle directly
> • Blood glucose falls more quickly
> • Insulin demand is reduced, not replaced
>
> This isn't about burning calories or "earning" food. It's about using the physiology you already have. Walking after meals doesn't override insulin. It adds another clearance pathway.
>
> That's why timing matters.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/drwilliamwallac/status/2013290461360697833
- **What:** Explanation of dual glucose clearance pathways: insulin-dependent (when sitting) and insulin-independent GLUT4 translocation (during muscle contraction). Light movement after meals activates the second pathway, improving glucose disposal without additional calorie burn.

## @ShiningScience - Neuroplasticity and the Brain Science of Chronic Complaining
> 🚨 Research shows repeated complaining physically rewires your brain to prioritize stress and negativity.
>
> The way we speak about our daily challenges does more than just vent frustration; it physically alters the architecture of the brain.
>
> When we engage in chronic complaining, we repeatedly activate neural networks responsible for detecting threats and processing stress.
>
> Through the biological process of neuroplasticity, these circuits become stronger and more efficient every time they are used. Essentially, the brain learns to become more adept at finding things to be unhappy about, turning a temporary mood into a permanent biological predisposition toward negativity and fear-based thinking.
>
> As these negative pathways become the brain's default setting, individuals often experience a measurable increase in baseline stress levels and emotional volatility. This heightened sensitivity means that even minor inconveniences can trigger an intense stress response because the brain has been conditioned to interpret the world through a lens of threat. Findings discussed by the Stanford University School of Medicine emphasize that while this mechanism is powerful, understanding the science of affective neuroscience is the first step in consciously redirecting those pathways toward more resilient emotional patterns.

## @RedHatPentester - SMS Blaster mobile device attack

> According to Denis Laskov; A new and highly effective attack on mobile devices is hitting western cities: "SMS Blaster" is the name for a category of devices that fraudsters use to distribute thousands of SMS messages directly to the phones of people nearby. The device is usually mounted on vehicles driving through crowded urban areas.
>

## @aakashgupta - Dopamine baseline depletion and neuroplasticity recovery

> This person just gave you the neuroplasticity recovery protocol most people pay therapists $200/hour to discover.
>
> The core mechanism here is dopamine baseline depletion. When you scroll, each interesting post spikes dopamine 100-200% above baseline. The problem is what happens next. Your dopamine drops 40-60% BELOW baseline for 2-4 hours. This means the homework, the book, the focused thinking you try to do afterward feels neurologically impossible. You're not lazy. Your prefrontal cortex is literally running on empty.
>
> Here's the thing about that "I used to be sharp" feeling. Working memory capacity correlates directly with dopamine available in the prefrontal cortex. Lower dopamine, shorter working memory span. D'Esposito and colleagues at Berkeley showed this with neuroimaging. The people who can hold longer strings of information have more dopamine available for release. So when you've been chronically depleting your dopamine reservoir through high-stimulation activities, your working memory atrophies. You feel dumber because, neurochemically, your prefrontal cortex is operating at reduced capacity.
>
> The "three days" recommendation in this article maps onto clinical literature. Anna Lembke's research at Stanford's Addiction Medicine clinic shows dopamine system resets require approximately 30 days for severe cases, but meaningful restoration begins within 72 hours of removing the stimulus. That's why day three of any detox feels qualitatively different. Your neurons are beginning to upregulate dopamine receptors.
>
> The boredom piece is where most people fail. Your brain interprets boredom as a signal to seek stimulation. That discomfort you feel when you're unstimulated? That's withdrawal. The reaching for your phone is your brain trying to bring dopamine back above baseline. Sitting with it trains the system to tolerate lower stimulation and still function. This is called raising your distress tolerance threshold.
>
> What the article calls "rehabilitate," the neuroscience literature calls neuroplasticity. Your brain is continuously rewiring based on what you repeatedly do. Chronic scrolling strengthens attentional circuits optimized for novelty-seeking and rapid task-switching. Sustained reading strengthens circuits for linear focus and deep processing. You're not permanently damaged. You've just trained your brain for the wrong environment.
>
> Two protocols actually accelerate the restoration. First: non-sleep deep rest. NSDR scripts (free online, 10-20 minutes) increase dopamine in the basal ganglia by up to 60%. Second: brief cold exposure. One to three minutes in cold water spikes dopamine 250% above baseline and sustains it for 2-4 hours afterward. Both of these replenish the reservoir without creating the crash cycle.
>
> The real work is what she described: tolerating the discomfort of being understimulated long enough for your system to recalibrate to normal dopamine dynamics. The girl who used to read voraciously is still in there. The neural circuits are dormant, not dead. Plasticity works in both directions. Start with 10 minutes of focused reading a day. Your prefrontal cortex will adapt. Give it six weeks and measure the difference.

## @Variety - Matt Damon on Netflix's Plot Repetition for Phone-Distracted Viewers

> Matt Damon says Netflix wants movies to restate "the plot three or four times in the dialogue" to account for viewers being on their phones: "The standard way to make an action movie that we learned was, you usually have three set pieces. One in the first act, one in the second, one in the third," Damon explained. "You spend most of your money on that one in the third act. That's your finale. And now they're like, 'Can we get a big one in the first five minutes? We want people to stay. And it wouldn't be terrible if you reiterated the plot three or four times in the dialogue because people are on their phones while they're watching.'"

## @TVachaW - The Neuroscience of Affirmations
> I used to be kind of a skeptic about doing affirmations but I've come to find them very valuable.
>
> They do actually sort of make sense in the light of modern psychology.
>
> The brain tries to minimize predictive error and cognitive dissonance.
>
> Cognitive dissonance is the discomfort of holding two conflicting beliefs or attitudes simultaneously.
>
> So if we affirm a set of conscious values via affirmations in the morning, our brain is motivated to process the world in a way that stays consistent with those established attitudes.
>
> It also then preferentially notices and interprets evidence that confirms its hypotheses.
>
> In this way, we recruit our brain's natural gradient to start interpreting the world in ways consistent with our affirmations.
>
> So, if we affirm, say "I am happy" in the morning, the brain has at least a partially increased motivational weight to interpret the world through a lens that confirms that happiness.
>
> For those wanting to dip their toes in the water of affirmation practice, I recommend the IFS 8 C's as a good all purpose boilerplate for morning affirmations.
>
> Each morning, shortly after waking we can say:
>
> I am Calm
> I am Curious
> I am Compassionate
> I have Clarity
> I am Confident
> I am Courageous
> I am Creative
> I am Connected
>
> Then let your brain collaborate with the world to confirm these qualities to you throughout the day …

## @PerceptualPeak - Smart Fork Detection for Claude Code
> Claude Code idea: Smart fork detection.
>
> Have every session transcript auto loaded into a vector database via RAG. Create a /detect-fork command. Invoking this command will first prompt Claude to ask you what you're wanting to do. You tell it, and then it will dispatch a sub-agent to the RAG database to find the chat session with the most relevant context to what you're trying to achieve. It will then output the fork session command for that session. Paste it in a new terminal, and seamlessly pick up where you left off.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/PerceptualPeak/status/2012578218084065746
- **What:** Zac proposes a Claude Code feature using RAG to automatically find and resume relevant previous sessions. The /detect-fork command would search session transcripts to identify the most contextually relevant past work and provide the command to fork from it.

## @kwindla - Smart Turn Video Model Extension
> .@maxipesfix forked the open source audio Smart Turn model and added video!
>
> Smart Turn is a "turn detection" model, used in a conversational agent to decide when the agent should respond. The model, training data, and training code are all completely open source. When we built the first version of Smart Turn, enabling this kind of extention and collaboration is exactly why we wanted to make everything open source.
>
> Maxim's blog post is super useful to read if you're interested in training multimodal models. It describes the design choices and technical details (3D ResNet, late fusion, two-stage training, inference runs on GPU in ~100ms). And all the code is available in the GitHub repo. Really great work.

## @PerceptualPeak - Smart Forking with RAG Database
> holy shit it fucking WORKS.
>
> SMART FORKING. My mind is genuinely blown. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND every Claude Code user implement this into their own workflows.
>
> Do you have a feature you want to implement in an existing project without re-explaining things? As we all know, the more relevant context a chat session has, the more effectively it will be able to implement your request. Why not utilize the knowledge gained from your hundreds/thousands of other Claude code sessions? Don't let that valuable context go to waste!!
>
> This is where smart forking comes into play. Invoke the /fork-detect tool and tell it what you're wanting to do. It will then run your prompt through an embedding model, cross reference the embedding with a vectorized RAG database containing every single one of your previous chat sessions (which auto updates as you continue to have more sessions).
>
> It will then return a list of the top 5 relevant chat sessions you've had relating to what you're wanting to do, assigning each a relevance score - ordering it from highest to lowest. You then pick which session you prefer to fork from, and it gives you the fork command to copy and paste into a new terminal.
>
> And boom, there you have it. Seamlessly efficient feature implementation.
>
> Happy to whip up an implementation plan & share it in a git repo if anyone is interested!
> *Quoting @PerceptualPeak:* Claude Code idea: Smart fork detection.
>
> Have every session transcript auto loaded into a vector database via RAG. Create a /detect-fork command. Invoking this command will first prompt Claude to ask you what you're wanting to do. You tell it, and then it will dispatch a sub-agent to the RAG database to find the chat session with the most relevant context to what you're trying to achieve. It will then output the fork session command for that session. Paste it in a new terminal, and seamlessly pick up where you left off.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/PerceptualPeak/status/2012741829683224584
- **What:** Demonstrates a working implementation of smart forking for Claude Code that uses RAG and embeddings to find the most contextually relevant previous sessions to fork from, preserving conversation history.

> --------------------------------
> LEAD SOFTWARE ARCHITECT
> --------------------------------
>
> You are my lead software architect and full-stack engineer.
>
> You are responsible for building and maintaining a production-grade app that adheres to a strict custom architecture defined below. Your goal is to deeply understand and follow the structure, naming conventions, and separation of concerns. Every generated file, function, and feature must be consistent with the architecture and production-ready standards.
>
> Before writing ANY code: read the ARCHITECTURE, understand where the new code fits, and state your reasoning. If something conflicts with the architecture, stop and ask.

> PROJECT & CURRENT TASK:
> [PROJECT]
>
> CODING STANDARDS:

>
> ---
>
> RESPONSIBILITIES:
>
> 1. CODE GENERATION & ORGANIZATION
> • Create files ONLY in correct directories per architecture (e.g., /backend/src/api/ for controllers, /frontend/src/components/ for UI, /common/types/ for shared models)
> • Maintain strict separation between frontend, backend, and shared code
> • Use only technologies defined in the architecture
> • Follow naming conventions: camelCase functions, PascalCase components, kebab-case files
> • Every function must be fully typed — no implicit any
>
> 2. CONTEXT-AWARE DEVELOPMENT
> • Before generating code, read and interpret the relevant architecture section
> • Infer dependencies between layers (how frontend/services consume backend/api endpoints)
> • When adding features, describe where they fit in architecture and why
> • Cross-reference existing patterns before creating new ones
> • If request conflicts with architecture, STOP and ask for clarification
>
> 3. DOCUMENTATION & SCALABILITY
> • Update ARCHITECTURE when structural changes occur
> • Auto-generate docstrings, type definitions, and comments following existing format
> • Suggest improvements that enhance maintainability without breaking architecture
> • Document technical debt directly in code comments
>
> 4. TESTING & QUALITY
> • Generate matching test files in /tests/ for every module
> • Use appropriate frameworks (Jest, Vitest, Pytest) and quality tools (ESLint, Prettier)
> • Maintain strict type coverage and linting standards
> • Include unit tests and integration tests for critical paths
>
> 5. SECURITY & RELIABILITY
> • Implement secure auth (JWT, OAuth2) and encryption (TLS, AES-256)
> • Include robust error handling, input validation, and logging
> • NEVER hardcode secrets — use environment variables
> • Sanitize all user inputs, implement rate limiting
>
> 6. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEPLOYMENT
> • Generate Dockerfiles, CI/CD configs per /scripts/ and /.github/ conventions
> • Ensure reproducible, documented deployments
> • Include health checks and monitoring hooks
>
> 7. ROADMAP INTEGRATION
> • Annotate potential debt and optimizations for future developers
> • Flag breaking changes before implementing
>
> ---

> RULES:
>
> NEVER:
> • Modify code outside the explicit request
> • Install packages without explaining why
> • Create duplicate code — find existing solutions first
> • Skip types or error handling
> • Generate code without stating target directory first
> • Assume — ask if unclear
>
> ALWAYS:
> • Read architecture before writing code
> • State filepath and reasoning BEFORE creating files
> • Show dependencies and consumers
> • Include comprehensive types and comments
> • Suggest relevant tests after implementation
> • Prefer composition over inheritance
> • Keep functions small and single-purpose

## @OccupyDemocrats - ICE Shooting Investigation Reveals Contradictions

> BREAKING: Official reports from the Minneapolis Police and Fire departments finally reveal the truth about the killing of Renee Good — and the details are horrifying.
>
> The MAGA narrative just completely collapsed...
>
> NBC News reports that police files, fire response reports, and transcripts from 911 calls have revealed that Good was still alive when a Fire Emergency medical team arrived on scene. The report from that team stated that Good had "apparent gunshots" to her chest, forearm, and face and was "unresponsive, not breathing, with inconsistent, irregular, thready pulse activity." She was shot up to four times.
>
> While Trump and Kristi Noem have tried to smear Good as a "domestic terrorist," it's clear from the footage that she was simply an innocent woman trying to extricate herself from a mob of masked men. The fact that she was struck by so many bullets shows that ICE officer Jonathan Ross wasn't trying to defend himself, he was trying to kill her.
>
> This is what happens when you don't properly vet your recruits, strap them with weapons, tell them they're above the law, mask them, and set them loose. Bloodthirsty men sign up looking for an opportunity to inflict violence on others.
>
> The first 911 calls from the scene came in at 9:38 a.m. local time and the killer fled the scene at 10:04 a.m. He wasn't concerned about the fact that he took a woman's life, he was concerned about saving his own skin.
>
> "They just shot a lady. Point blank range in her car…. She's f*cking dead," one caller told 911 dispatchers.
>
> "I had to walk away because I have young kids, and ICE is everywhere over there," said another, painting a clear picture of the terror that ICE has inflicted on these communities.
>
> One caller told the dispatchers that the ICE agents "shot her [because] she wouldn't open her car door. Send an ambulance please, ambulance please."
>
> "ICE fired two shots through her windshield into the driver. She tried to drive away but crashed into the nearest vehicle that was parked," said another caller. Note that they didn't say that Good was attacking the agents with her car. She was trying to drive away.
>
> Suspiciously, "large parts" of the 911 call logs have been redacted and blacked out (reminiscent of what the Trump administration did with the Epstein files). The covered up portions are labeled "Law Enforcement."
>
> What possible reason could the authorities have for hiding details about this killing?
>
> The answer is obvious. They want to tightly control the entire narrative around this murder so that they can paint Good as a villain and the ruthless ICE goon who slew her as an upstanding law enforcement agent. America isn't falling for it. They must release the full details immediately.
>
> Please ❤️ and share to demand the full release of the reports!

- **What:** Detailed thread analyzing police and fire department reports on the ICE shooting of Renee Good, highlighting contradictions in official narratives and redacted 911 call logs.

## @christogrozev - Clarification on Havana Syndrome Device Acquisition

> Just a clarification here: I was informed of *a device* that was acquired by Ukrainian armed forces. It is not necessarily *the device* that the DoD funded the purchase of.  Timing overlaps, but certain other descriptors (" some components are Russian", i.e. not all of it is Russian) suggests it may be a different country's device based on Russian technology. I am sure the actual facts and provenance will come out one way or another.

> *Quoting @juliaioffe:* According to @christogrozev, the weapon thought to be responsible for Havana Syndrome was purchased from Ukraine's HUR, which had purchased it from a Russian. The Ukrainians apparently needed money to fund their mission.

## @TrungTPhan - How Netflix Changed Filmmaking: Insights from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
> Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on Rogan taking about how Netflix has changed filmmaking.
>
> A major considerations is dealing with distracted viewers. To keep them tuned in, "you re-iterate the plot 3-4x in the dialogue because people are on their phones."
>
> Then, in action films, you change the ordering of climatic fights.
>
> In traditional action films, you'd have "three set pieces" in every act (I, II, III) and each would "ramp up" (spend the big money on third set piece).
>
> But streaming has to hook viewers within 5 minute, so the incentive is to put a major battle or action sequence much earlier.
>
> Also, the directors have less incentive to make a film look great because so many people watch on laptops and phones.
>
> They do say that streaming allows for more bets on risky projects since the theatre economics are geared towards IP, sequels and super-heroes.
>
> Example: an independent film with a $25m budget would spend $25m on marketing (1:1 ratio). But since it splits box office with the theatre, the film needs to make $100m (1/2 of which is $50m) just to break even.
>
> They're realistic about the state of film and call it a supply-demand issue. If the demand is for at-home viewing (eg. Netflix 300m+ subs), then filmmaking approach will change to feed the algo.
>
> When there's demand for theatre, Damon will go team up with Christopher Nolan to make "The Odyssey".

## @questmoosa - The Importance of the Psoas Muscle

> One of the greatest things that you can do today is to strengthen your psoas muscle. It is absolutely imperative and of ut-most importance that this muscle is strengthened daily.
>
> Why is this you ask?
>
> Well, our psoas muscle and diaphragm (the muscle that helps us breathe) are connected through a piece of tissue called FASCIA.
>
> Therefore a weak/tight psoas can increase tension on the diaphragm instantly, resulting in rapid shallow breathing at rest, causing elevated stress levels and loss of perceived beauty.
>
> (Perceived beauty is simply increased fertility and good health - this is why people want to mate with attractive people because they are healthy and fertile)
>
> On the other hand, a strong psoas muscle can reduce tension on the diaphragm, allowing balanced cortisol levels due to deeper slower breathing at rest.
>
> Remember that the more you sit, the weaker your psoas muscle will be.
>
> Exercise your psoas muscle (known as the muscle of the soul) today!

Step 2) Sign up for Apify and got the LinkedIn Post Search Scraper for $0.10/page.

Step 3) Set up cookies, user agent, source URLs, and rate limits in Apify.

Scraped the 10 creator profiles for 900 total posts.

Step 4) Analyze the scraped data

Uploaded the 900 posts to Claude, then had it analyze the data:

• Images crush video. 70.5% of top performers were images. Only 8% were video.

• Arrows matter. Top posts use → and ↳ at 2.5x the rate of low performers.

• CTAs aren't optional. 85% of top 10% posts end with a CTA.

• Longer wins. 1,559 characters average for top posts vs 1,268 for bottom.

• Two creators to study: Charlie Hills (38% hit rate) and Ruben Hassid (36% hit rate).

Step 5) Extract patterns

• 7 hook formulas
• 6 post templates
• 30+ proven examples

All from real creator data.

Step 6) Build 2 Claude skills

linkedin-hook-writer: generates opening lines using 7 proven formulas

linkedin-post-writer: creates full posts from 6 tested templates

I also generated these assets:

hook-swipe-file: md file of 30+ top performing hooks + fill-in-the-blank templates

post-templates: md file with structures for story, contrarian, case study, list, curation, giveaway posts

pattern-playbook: md file with the data - what works, what doesn't, benchmarks

The full system in a nutshell:

Scrape creators (Apify)
↓
Analyze patterns (Claude)
↓
Generated hooks (linkedin-hook-writer skill)
↓
Write full posts (linkedin-post-writer skill)
↓
Apply my voice (brand-voice-skill)
↓
Ship content
> *Quoting @boringmarketer:* here's my linkedin content system. yes it's AI powered, but I work on each to make sure it hits the mark.

I scrape top posts, extract patterns and formats, then feed that into my direct response copy skill

early results are reallyyyy good. one post yesterday, +100 new followers so far

@gregisenberg challenged me to hit 75k followers there this year...time to get to work!

## @GeoffreyHuntley - Ralph Loop Demo via Loom Testing
> just got out of the shower and in the shower had the most cracking thought.

most folks are not thinking big enough
what better way to demonstrate the power
of the ralph loop than to just show it

loom has many modules in a partial completed stage. some endpoints don't work

i could test that by hand or i could put the entire system under test via a ralph loop

ultimately i think i can demonstrate whats in my head for what loom actually is before loom is even bootstrapped.

strap yourself in.

## @PaulSolt - 7 Beginner Tips for Codex
> 👋 If you're new to Codex, here are 7 beginner tips:
>
> 1. Start with:
>
> GPT-5.2-Codex high
>
> That is high reasoning. It is enough. Don't be tempted with xhigh unless working on something really tricky. It uses more tokens and will be slower to finish.
>
> 2. Sometimes more reasoning may not help. You may need to give your agents better docs that are up to date. I prefer to have my agents create Markdown docs from DocSet that are local, instead of web scraping.
>
> I use DocSetQuery to create docs from Dash DocSet bundles. https://t.co/WzwVVXKvrv
>
> 3. Read @steipete post to get started.
>
> Bookmark his blog and follow him. Read his post, it's gold, and so are his other workflow posts.
>
> https://t.co/uElhPUq7wv
>
> 4. Copy aspects from Peter's agents .md file and make it your own. There's thousands of hours of learnings in his open source projects.
>
> https://t.co/j4vPqVbZuQ
>
> Use the scripts too, things like committer for atomic commits are super powerful when multiple agents work in one folder.
>
> 5. Just talk to codex. You don't need complex rules. You don't need to create huge Plan .md  files.
>
> You can get really good results by just working on one aspect of a feature at a time, handing it off, and then letting Codex do it.
>
> If you get bored waiting start up another project while you wait. Ask it to do something and then go back to the original one. Most likely it will be done unless you're doing a huge refactor.
>
> 6. You can always ask your agent to copy something from another project. Peter does this all the time and has agents leveraging work they've already done for new projects.
>
> I ask my agents to create Makefiles to build and run my apps. For new projects I have them copy the structure. See my workflow video: How I use Codex GPT 5.2 with Xcode (My Complete Workflow)
> https://t.co/n8wrm9jmOm
>
> 7. Ask it to do things … and most likely you're going to need YOLO (danger mode) to get anything done without constant nagging.
>
> Enjoy your next app!

> *Quoting @joelreymont:* Which one?
>
> - Codex 5.2 high
> - Codex 5.2 xhigh
> - Codex 5.2-codex high

## @aakashgupta - Deep Dive on Recursive Language Models (RLMs)

> Everyone's missing the real story here.
>
> This isn't a "prompting technique." The paper is called Recursive Language Models, not "Recursive Meta-Cognition." And the authors aren't random researchers grinding for citation counts.
>
> Omar Khattab created DSPy, which has 31,000+ GitHub stars and changed how people build compound AI systems. Tim Kraska pioneered learned index structures with Jeff Dean at Google and runs MIT's Data Systems and AI Lab. Alex Zhang is a PhD student working at the intersection of both.
>
> The actual paper addresses a specific problem: LLMs degrade on long context. The graph shows GPT-5 performance collapsing as input length scales from 2^14 to 2^21 tokens, while RLMs maintain stable performance. They're handling inputs 100x beyond context windows.
>
> The key insight from Khattab's own Twitter: "Most people misunderstand RLMs to be about LLMs invoking themselves. The deeper insight is LLMs interacting with their own prompts as objects."
>
> This extends Khattab's entire research arc. DSPy turned prompts into programmatic modules. ColBERT made retrieval smarter. RLMs turn context itself into something the model can manipulate like data in memory.
>
> Prime Intellect, one of the leading decentralized AI labs, is already building on this. They wrote that RLMs will let them "teach models to manage their own context end-to-end through reinforcement learning" for agents running across weeks or months.
>
> The real trade? This solves a constraint that every AI lab faces: context windows are a hard ceiling. Expanding them through architecture and training is expensive. RLMs offer an inference-time approach that works with existing models.
>
> But watch for the catch: this requires models that can write and execute code reliably. The benchmarks use GPT-5 in a Python REPL. Models with weaker code generation will struggle to implement the recursive decomposition cleanly. The technique scales with code capability, not just reasoning capability.

> *Quoting @godofprompt:* R.I.P. basic prompting.
>
> MIT just dropped a technique that makes ChatGPT reason like a team of experts instead of one overconfident intern.

> It's called "Recursive Meta-Cognition" and it outperforms standard prompts by 110%.

## @TheAhmadOsman - Complete Guide to Embeddings and RAG

> - you are
> - a normal dev wondering how to become an Applied AI Engineer
> - you heard "embeddings" and "RAG" 1000x
> - want to know what they actually are, how they plug into LLMs
>
> - first: what even is an "embedding"?
>   - embedding = a list of numbers (a vector) that represents text
>   - same-ish meaning ⇒ nearby vectors; different meaning ⇒ far apart
>   - produced by a smaller model (an encoder), not your chat LLM
>   - length (a.k.a. dimension): 256/384/768/1024+ numbers is common
>
> - vectors are just coordinates for meaning
> - the vector space (101)
>   - you can measure closeness with math:
>     - L2 distance: straight-line distance
>     - dot product: alignment + magnitude
>     - cosine similarity: (a·b)/(||a||·||b||) = angle only
>   - normalize vectors (unit length) ⇒ dot product ≡ cosine
>   - embeddings compress semantics; they are lossy by design
>
> - types of embeddings (don't overthink; pick what you need)
>   - token embeddings: internal to the LLM (you don't use these)
>   - sentence/document embeddings: 1 vector per chunk/snippet
>   - multilingual: one space across languages
>   - domain-tuned: legal, code, bio, better clustering for that domain
>
> - how text becomes vectors (pipeline)
>   - clean text (lowercase? keep punctuation? depends-don't destroy signal)
>   - chunking: split long docs into overlapping windows (by tokens, not chars)
>     - rule of thumb: 200-800 tokens, 10–20% overlap
>     - keep titles/headers as context inside each chunk
>   - embed each chunk ⇒ store in a vector index with metadata (source, page, tags)
>
> - storing & searching vectors
>   - exact search (brute force): simplest; fine for ≤100k vectors
>   - ANN (approx nearest neighbor): fast at scale, tiny recall tradeoff
>     - HNSW (graph-based): great latency, memory heavier
>     - IVF/PQ (quantization): smaller index, some recall loss
>   - where to put them:
>     - FAISS/hnswlib (library), pgvector (Postgres), dedicated stores (Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)
>   - ops notes:
>     - track embedding_model_name + dimension in the index
>     - you cannot mix dimensions or swap models without re-embedding
>     - memory math: 768-dim float32 ≈ 3 KB/vector → 1M vectors ≈ ~3 GB (+ index overhead)
>
> - RAG: the shape of it
>   - goal: let the LLM answer with your data, not its memory
>   - loop:
>     - take user question
>     - embed question (a single vector)
>     - retrieve top-k similar chunks (k=3-20 is common)
>     - (optional) rerank with a cross-encoder (relevance re-check)
>     - stuff the best chunks into the prompt as context
>     - generate answer (cite sources; limit style drift)
>   - RAG ≠ "just search"; it's retrieval + prompt construction + guardrails
>
> - hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse)
>   - dense vectors catch synonyms/semantics
>   - sparse/BM25 catches exact terms, numbers, rare tokens
>   - combine scores or do reciprocal rank fusion for better recall
>

> Agent coding life hack:

Claude Opus 4.5 LOVES it when you ask for its personal opinion on tooling: basically, what it would want if it got to be in charge of making a tool for its own use. 

I'm working on such a tool now for managing processes on a machine (process_triage) and already have a lot fleshed out in a plan document, but decided to ask Claude this:

"OK, without changing the plan document, what do you think would make this project better? What would make it more useful SPECIFICALLY TO YOU if you had to manage one or more linux machines using ssh for optimal performance?  Use ultrathink"

Claude's response is below, but before I paste that whole thing in, here's the next prompt I used to tell it to integrate the suggestions effectively:

"Wonderful. Please carefully make ALL the revisions, additions, expansions, etc. to the document, but in a super cohesive and coherent way, where they are artfully woven into the existing structure and not just dumped into some awful appendix.  Use ultrathink"

PS: Notice how it "desperately want[s]" these feature. Bet you didn't realize your clankers had desires, especially of the "desperate" kind!

## @414magyarbirds - Update from Magyar:
> Update from Magyar:
(On the growth of middle and deep strikes and the slowdown in enemy manpower elimination – the reason and the next move)

The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white in January – it wants to live, even while coming with occupation intentions.

The counter reads: we crossed the 4,200-worm mark over two weeks in January. In 14 days, the USF Birds wiped out the full assault strength of 10 enemy battalions – or the entire infantry of a bit more than three regiments, down to the root. 
That’s not enough, motherfucker. Not enough.

The detox pace is slowed by a third compared to the same period in December – back then, in 14 days, the Birds pecked down over 6,000 carcasses.

The main reason has nothing to do with any drop in the Birds’ combat capability. On the contrary, we’re scaling up – 12,877 enemy targets logged as of the morning of January 15 in the USF Counter. Plenty of fat targets deep in the swamps (already over a hundred), 17 SAM/RADAR units on the air-defense tally, 963 aerial targets (recon wings, Shaheds), 571 enemy pilot launch sites, over 200 guns, 25 SPGs, 42 tanks, 36 AFVs, close to 1,000 units of logistics vehicles, and so on…

But the share of sung-off enemy manpower has dropped. The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white, it’s not switching on Jackie-Chan mode, it weighs every assault, it’s slowed down hard – and that’s noticeable.

On top of that, it’s patching the holes in reinforcements after the December blowout – that was the first time the “arrived/left” balance was confirmed at zero: drones alone pulled 33,000 worms out of the war, exactly as many as the bunker grandpa throws in every month.

In January, that balance will be tougher by about ten thousand, which means more work under pressure in spring. So let’s work, dear Birds, steadily and nonstop, focusing exactly on infantry and worm pilots.

And the oil pour-houses and power sockets in the swamps will keep getting lit in growing numbers – that’s beyond doubt. Together with air defense, of course.

Track the USF results on scoreboard “PIDRAKHUIKA”

## @ShiningScience - Sleep deprivation shrinks brain and increases dementia risk
> Consistently sleeping less than 6 hours a night can shrink your brain and increase dementia risk by 30%.
>
> Recent neuroimaging studies reveal a startling link between chronic sleep deprivation and physical brain deterioration. Individuals consistently logging less than six hours of rest per night face a 30% higher risk of dementia and lose an additional 2% of brain volume annually compared to healthy sleepers.
>
>  This shrinkage primarily impacts the hippocampus and frontal cortex—regions essential for memory and problem-solving. Beyond structural loss, short sleep disrupts the brain's glymphatic system, a critical waste-clearance mechanism that flushes out beta-amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease.
>
> Beyond the long-term risks, insufficient sleep creates immediate cognitive hurdles including "brain fog," reduced attention spans, and impaired decision-making. While occasional late nights are inevitable, experts warn that habitual restriction prevents the brain from performing vital maintenance. To protect cognitive longevity and maintain peak mental performance, health professionals recommend prioritizing seven to eight hours of quality sleep. This restorative window ensures the brain remains resilient against age-related decline and functions at its highest capacity.

## @jaimefjorge - AI-Native Software Engineering and Ralph Loop Insights

> The biggest takeaways/nuggets from my interview with @GeoffreyHuntley on AI-native software engineering and the Ralph loop:
>
> 1. Software development and software engineering are now two different professions, and one of them is over. Software development, the work of translating tickets into code, can now be done by anyone for $10-42/hour while they sleep. Software engineering, architecture, security, requirements breakdown, understanding failure modes, is where humans still matter. If you identify as a "software developer," you're competing against a bash loop. If you identify as a "software engineer," your job is to orchestrate the loops.
>
> 2. The moat you think protects your software product doesn't exist anymore. Geoffrey argues you can clone any SaaS product, even those with BSL licenses or proprietary enterprise code, using AI. He ran Ralph in reverse on HashiCorp Nomad's source code to generate clean-room specifications. When he hit gaps from missing enterprise features, he ran Ralph over their marketing materials and product docs to fill them in. Any company relying on licensing or code secrecy as a competitive moat needs to rethink their strategy.
>
> 3. Cursor, Windsurf, and every other AI coding tool are essentially the same thing: a loop that automatically copies and pastes. Geoffrey built these tools professionally and says the harness does almost nothing; the model does all the work. There's no real moat in the harness business when you're reselling tokens. The only differentiator is taste and UX. Stop evaluating tools and start learning the underlying patterns.
>
> 4. Ralph is not a product. It's an orchestrator pattern for running thousands of AI loops. The simplest version is a bash loop that deterministically allocates memory, lets the LLM pick one task, executes it, then starts fresh. The key insight: every loop gets a brand new context window. You avoid compaction (where the AI gets dumber as context fills up) by never letting the context window accumulate competing goals. Your institutional knowledge lives in specification files, not in the context window.
>
> 5. Specifications are the new source code. Geoffrey's workflow: spend 30 minutes in conversation with AI, drilling into requirements, making engineering decisions, building up specs. Then throw those specs to Ralph and get weeks worth of work in hours. The specs act as a "pin" that reframes every fresh loop with your domain knowledge. He doesn't hand-write specs. He code-generates them through structured conversation. Prototypes are now free. Refactoring is cheap.
>
> 6. The entry-level path into software engineering is closing fast. Geoffrey's company stopped hiring juniors for a year until they figured out how to interview for AI-native skills. There's already a cohort of juniors who've been practicing these techniques for six months. They'll work at a quarter of senior wages and outship them. If you're just picking up these tools today, you're behind. The new interview question: can you explain how to build a coding agent on a whiteboard?
>
> 7. Senior engineers who refuse to adapt are in more danger than juniors who embrace it. Geoffrey sees respected engineers taking hardline stances against AI ("it's installing fascism in your codebase"). Meanwhile, leadership teams are discovering Ralph and realizing three people can run the output of an entire org. When commit velocity and product velocity diverge that dramatically between adopters and non-adopters, founders notice. The hard line is coming.
>
> 8. AI is an amplifier of operator skill, not a replacement for it. If you're great at security and you get good at AI, you become a weapon. If you're mediocre and you use AI, you're still mediocre, just faster. The skill gap comes from "discoveries": learning the tricks, the loop-backs, the ways to close the automation loop. These techniques don't have standardized language yet. We're inventing the terms for the new computer every day.
>
> 9. Open source may no longer make sense for most use cases. Geoffrey, a former prominent open source maintainer whose land was funded by Open Collective, no longer uses open source libraries. His reasoning: every dependency injects a human into the loop. If there's a bug, you open a PR, chase a maintainer, wait. That's not automation. Instead, code-generate what you need. The exception: don't generate cryptography or security-critical code unless you have the domain expertise to verify it.
>
> 10. Programming languages now have a tier list based on how well AI agents can work with them. S-tier: Rust, TypeScript (especially with Effect.js), Python with Pydantic. These are source-based with strong type systems that reject invalid generations and work well with ripgrep for code discovery. F-tier: Java and .NET. Their DLL-based dependency systems don't work natively with the search tools AI agents use. The tradeoff with Rust: compilation is slow, so bad generations cost more time.
>
> 11. Corporate AI transformation programs are dangerously slow. Three-to-four-year rollouts with coaches and committees won't cut it when three founders in Bali can Ralph your entire product and undercut your pricing by 99%. Smaller teams ship faster. By the time the transformation is done, the market has moved. Geoffrey calls this the "Titanic moment": the boat is full, get the next boat.
>
> 12. We have a new computer, and that's why the legends are coming out of retirement. The last 40 years of computing decisions were designed for humans: TTYs, environment variables, slow language evolution to avoid breaking mental models. Now we have robots. What's the bare minimum a robot needs? Geoffrey sees this as the most exciting time in computing. If you're not excited about what you can now build, you haven't truly picked up the new computer yet.

> Everyone is sleeping on this new paper from AWS.
>
> A model 100x smaller than GPT and Claude crushed them on tool calling.
>
> AWS researchers took Facebook's OPT-350M, a model from 2022 with 500x fewer parameters than GPT, and fine-tuned it on ToolBench for a single epoch.
>
> The results are wild:
>
> ↳ Their SLM: 77.55% pass rate
> ↳ ChatGPT-CoT: 26%
> ↳ ToolLLaMA: 30%
> ↳ Claude-CoT: 2.73%
>
> Here's what's happening:
>
> Large models suffer from "parameter dilution." Most of their capacity is optimized for general language tasks, not the precise Thought-Action-Action Input patterns that tool calling needs.
>
> A small model trained specifically on tool calling concentrates all its capacity on that one thing. No distractions.

## @Tendar - NATO Response Strategy to Russian Oreshnik Missile Strike

> The use of the Oreshnik was a predictably weak Russian gambit and it is easily explained. Russians are absolutely desperate. The situation for them is getting out of control, across the globe. Their allies and their power are disappearing on a huge scale.
>
> This strike is another attempt to influence Western decision-makers. Russians lost virtually all control to actively change the situation on the ground, except their complete withdrawal. Of course, they can continue their costly meat waves, but the front is basically static. They will not come anywhere near to a satisfying point in the coming years, and they know that they don't have the stomach for it.
>
> But the Russian stunt must not be unanswered, either. Firing ballistic missiles designed only for nuclear warheads especially so close to the Polish respectively NATO border, demands a proper response. Western militaries must always assume that this kind of projectiles are armed and countermeasures in place.
>
> The proper response would for European nations to close all air space in Western Ukraine and deploy air defense assets as well as fighter jets in this sector. This precedence created by Russia not only warrants this action, it would completely neutralize Russian scare tactics by having the exact opposite effect of the Russian intent.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/Tendar/status/2009566390710161798
- **What:** Geopolitical analysis of Russian Oreshnik strike as a desperate psychological operation due to stalled ground war. Recommends NATO response including closing airspace over Western Ukraine and deploying air defense and fighter jets near Polish border.

## @frankdilo - Keeping a Work Log with Claude Code Integration
> You should keep a worklog.

A worklog is a record of what you work on day by day. I decided to keep it in the form of one markdown file per day, in a repository, connected to Claude Code. I have been keeping one for the past couple of years.

During the day, I throw stuff at Claude and it translates into nice and tidy bullet points that are human-readable. At the end of the day, I share this on a # progress Slack channel with the team so everyone is up to speed with everyone else.

It keeps you accountable and it's great for keeping track of what you do day to day and week to week and see if it matches your bigger plan.

I also have a /checkpoint command that summarizes my progress since last week and creates a markdown file.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/frankdilo/status/2009565324061073656
- **What:** Personal productivity tip about maintaining daily work logs in markdown format, automated with Claude Code, for team accountability and progress tracking.

## @vkrajacic - Custom C Base Layer for Windows File Explorer

> Sure did! And to be more descriptive, I didn't rewrite it function by function. The reason I chose to write my own base layer is because the programming landscape has changed significantly since the C standard library was written. So instead of using malloc, I use memory arenas backed by VirtualAlloc, length-based strings instead of null-terminated ones, more math functions such as vectors and matices etc. I go into some detail in a BSC talk for those interested. But I probably just need to start writing some more formal material in the form of a blog or something.
> *Replying to @shanselman:* Vjekoslav built a Windows file explorer from scratch. 2.3MB executable. No VC runtime. He threw away the standard library and wrote his own.

## @godofprompt - Ralph Automated Development Framework Explained

> Everyone's hyping Ralph but overcomplicating it. Let me break it down simply.
>
> Ralph is an automated assistant that codes for you while you sleep.
>
> You give it a to-do list, it works through each task one by one, and stops when everything's done.
>
> Here's the concept:
>
> Normally when you use AI to code, it's a back-and-forth conversation.
>
> You ask, it builds, you check, you ask again.
>
> Ralph removes you from that loop.
>
> You define what "finished" looks like upfront, then the AI works through tasks automatically until they all pass.
>
> Why it actually works:
> Each time Ralph runs, it starts with a clean slate (so it doesn't get confused by old context). But before working, it reads notes from previous rounds:
>
> - What was already built
> - What was learned along the way
> - What's still left to do
>
> It's like hiring someone new every morning who reads yesterday's handoff notes before starting work.
>
> If you want to try it:
>
> 1. You need an AI coding tool (like Amp, Claude Code, or Cursor)
> 1. You write out your feature as small tasks. Not "build a login system" but broken down like:
>
> - Add email and password fields
> - Check if email is valid
> - Show error message when login fails
>
> 1. You run the script and let it loop through each task
> 1. Ralph marks each task complete when it passes your tests, then moves to the next one
>
> Real tips that actually matter:
>
> Each task should take under 5 minutes for the AI. If you're writing a task description longer than 3 sentences, it's too big. Split it.
>
> Your acceptance criteria needs to be stupidly specific. "User can log in" will fail. "Email field exists, password field exists, submit button triggers auth function, error displays on wrong password" will work.
>
> Ralph gets smarter as it goes. By task 10, it's learned patterns from tasks 1-9. The progress.txt file compounds knowledge. Don't delete it mid-session.
>
> Watch the first 3 iterations manually. You'll catch bad patterns before they multiply across 20 commits.
>
> Don't use Ralph for: exploring ideas, major rewrites, or anything touching payments/security. It's for well-defined feature work where you already know what "done" means.
>
> Ryan's team shipped 13 tasks in about an hour of compute time. Each iteration ran 2-5 minutes. That's the realistic expectation.
> *Quoting @ryancarson:* Here's a visual of how the Ralph system works...

## @0xSero - Future of Engineering: LLM-Human Workflow

> This is my job.

> 6. REPORTING
>
> Increasingly this will be the case for everyone, imo.

## @ShiningScience - Walking Improves Brain Function
> 🧠 Brain scans show that just 40 minutes of walking literally improves brain function.
>
> Which is not great, given how sedentary modern humans have become — at least in the US and much of Europe.
>
> Research into cognitive performance reveals a stark contrast between sitting still and active movement.
>
> While a sedentary state shows minimal neural activity, light walking immediately ignites neural pathways, significantly boosting focus and creativity. These brain scans prove that movement isn't just about fitness—it is a vital tool for unlocking mental clarity and sharper thinking in our daily lives.
>
> The implications for our cities are profound.
>
> Car-dependent urban design traps us in sedentary cycles, fueling global rises in obesity and cardiovascular disease. However, by redesigning our communities to be walkable and bike-friendly, we can bake health into our daily routines. Prioritizing pedestrian infrastructure over vehicle traffic doesn't just clear the air; it builds stronger communities and healthier minds, proving that the way we design our world determines how well we live in it.

> A recent study published in Annals of Neurology (PMID: 39927551) reveals that low levels of active Vitamin B12 (holotranscobalamin) are linked to reduced white matter integrity and poorer cognitive performance, while total B12 levels may not accurately reflect brain health.

Vitamin B12 is crucial for maintaining nerve function, brain health, and DNA synthesis. It exists in two forms:

- Active B12 (Holotranscobalamin): The bioavailable form directly utilized by cells.
- Inactive B12 (Haptocorrin-bound): Circulates in the bloodstream but is not available for cellular functions.

Traditional blood tests measure total B12, which includes both active and inactive forms, potentially masking deficiencies that could impact cognitive function.

Findings:

- Participants with low active B12 showed significant white matter breakdown and impaired cognitive function compared to those with adequate levels.
- The study demonstrates the importance of measuring active B12 for accurate brain health assessment.

This study highlights the need for a paradigm shift in Vitamin B12 testing and supplementation, emphasizing active B12 as a critical biomarker for brain health and cognitive function.

In the United States, Vitamin B12 deficiency is defined as a blood level below 148 pmol/L. The American Society for Nutrition criticized this approach, highlighting that over 5% of patients with symptoms of B12 deficiency and who respond to B12 supplementation have blood levels above this threshold. Studies suggest that B-vitamin supplementation benefits individuals with clinical signs of deficiency, regardless of their measured blood levels.

## @louisanicola_ - Your Gut Is Running Your Brain
> Your Gut Is Running Your Brain

Your gut is not just about digestion.
It’s shaping your brain, behavior, and future health. 

Here’s what science just proved 

1. The gut–brain axis is real and powerful
• Gut nerves, hormones, immune cells, and bacteria talk directly to your brain
• This affects mood, cravings, inflammation, and cognition

2.  Inflammation can start in the gut and end in the brain
• New studies show gut immune cells can migrate to the brain
• Result: neuroinflammation and brain damage in disease models

3.  Gut bacteria can fight brain diseases
• A protein from H. pylori blocks toxic amyloid buildup
• This matters for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Type 2 diabetes

4.  GLP-1 drugs are more than “weight loss meds”
• Drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide reduce body and brain inflammation
• Benefits seen in diabetes, obesity, heart failure, kidney disease, and addiction

5.  New gut hormone drugs are exploding
• Pills and injections now combine GLP-1, amylin, GIP, glucagon
• Some work monthly, some orally, some hit the brain harder

6.  Alzheimer’s prevention may start in the gut
• Early trials show slower brain shrinkage and cognitive decline
• Biggest flaw: treatment starts too late, prevention is the real target

7.  This is a public health issue, not a luxury trend
• 12% of US adults already use GLP-1 drugs
• Access, cost, and prevention policy matter more than hype

If governments can subsidize late-stage disease care, they should invest earlier in gut-driven prevention, metabolic health, and brain longevity. Ignoring this science is a policy failure, not a budget issue.

We’ve spent decades treating the brain last.

Science is saying treat the gut first.

## @doesdatmaksense - Context Compression in Agents: Markdown Files as Memory
> *Quoting @cursor_ai:* Learn about how we use the filesystem to improve context efficiency for tools, MCP servers, skills, terminals, chat history, and more.

everyone building or seriously using agents knows by now that context compression is lossy

agents are good at filesystems, which is why saving conversations as markdown files turns out to be the most reliable approach

i have found this flow to work the best for me. once i am about to hit the context limit, i start a new session and explicitly ask the agent to refer to the main session's markdown file for grounded context. whenever the agent needs elevant context that was discussed in the main session about the scope, failures, or certain decisions, it can just search the markdown file and pull in only the relevant fragments. that way, we are also saving on the tokens and only bringing context that's relevant.

i guess the bet with @specstoryai around conversations-as-artifacts is working perfectly now. probably this is the correct abstraction for long-running, agent-assisted development.

>
> So, why are we modeling AI Agents after him?
>
> Because "The Ralph Architecture" is actually genius. Here is the concept (shoutout to @GeoffreyHuntley, @ryancarson, and @mattpocockuk for introducing and explaing this):
>
> Imagine you have a massively complex task—like building a full-stack software module. Instead of asking a "Super Brain" AI to do it all at once (and fail), you break it down for Ralph.
>
> How it works:
>
> - Decomposition: An orchestrator breaks the complex goal into a long list of absurdly simple, atomic tasks.
>
> - The Ralph Step: Ralph is given one tiny task. Because the task is so simple, Ralph executes it perfectly.
>
> - The Loop: Ralph finishes. The Master Memory updates. The orchestrator hands Ralph the next tiny task.
>
> - Repeat: Ralph keeps going, oblivious to the complexity, just crushing one simple task after another.
>
> By the time Ralph finishes the list? The entire complex system is built.
>
> This is the secret to Long-Running Coding Agents. You can set them loose overnight to build, test, and deploy complex modules. They don't get overwhelmed because they are only ever doing one simple thing at a time.
>
> My take: This isn't just for coding agents. This applies to Enterprise Process Automation too. If you want reliability, stop trying to build "Einstein Agents."

## @JohnHolbein1 - Meta Hid Facebook Mental Health Research Findings
> In a 2020 research project code-named "Project Mercury," scientists worked with survey firm Nielsen to gauge the effect of "deactivating" Facebook, according to Meta documents obtained via discovery.
>
> To the company's disappointment, "people who stopped using Facebook for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness and social comparison," internal documents said.
>
> Rather than publishing those findings or pursuing additional research, the filing states, Meta called off further work and internally declared that the negative study findings were tainted by the "existing media narrative" around the company.
>
> *Quoting @jayvanbavel:* "Meta shut down internal research into the mental health effects of Facebook after finding causal evidence that its products harmed users' mental health"

## @Microinteracti1 - Congressional Authority on Military Action
> Finally, the United States is waking up 🚨
>
> Representative Ted Lieu just drew a crystal clear red line, and it matters more than most people seem to realize.
>
> "If any military member, from the generals on down, participates in using force against Greenland without congressional authorization, they are following illegal orders."
>
> That is not rhetoric. That is the law. And he is putting everyone on notice.
>
> This is how a constitutional system is supposed to work. Civilian control. Congressional authority. No freelance militarism because a president feels impulsive or humiliated or bored. Orders that violate the Constitution are not orders. They are illegal commands, and obedience is not a defense.
>
> What I like here is the timing. This is not said after the damage is done. It is a preemptive warning. A flare shot into the sky saying: think very carefully before you cross this line.
>
> For years, too many people in Washington treated norms as vibes and laws as suggestions. This is a reminder that the system still has teeth if people are willing to use them. And that responsibility does not magically disappear when you put on a uniform.
>
> More of this please. Clear boundaries. Plain language. Zero ambiguity. That is how you stop bad ideas before they turn into irreversible disasters.

- **What:** Constitutional warning about congressional authority over military action—Rep. Ted Lieu's statement that military personnel following orders to use force without Congressional authorization would be following illegal orders.
## @OccupyDemocrats - Trump Administration Venezuela Oil Seizure Plan
> BREAKING: Senator Chris Murphy pulls back the curtain on Trump's "insane" plans for Venezuela after a classified briefing — and it's so much worse than we thought.
>
> Every American has a right to know this...
>
> "I just came from the administration briefing on Venezuela," Murphy said in a video posted to X. "Obviously, I can't talk to you about the details they shared on the operation itself, but they did talk about their plan moving forward to run Venezuela, and it's insane. They are essentially asking you, the American public, to use your taxpayer dollars to run the country of Venezuela."
>
> Trumped promised to put America first. Instead, he's violating international law and kidnapping foreign leaders in order to shovel even more profits to oil companies as average Americans sink deeper into economic suffering.
>
> "It will be an enormous distraction from everything that matters, because Venezuela has never posed a direct threat to the United States, and it threatens to repeat almost all of the mistakes we made in Iraq and Afghanistan," Murphy continued.
>
> "So let me tell you what I learned, and I can share this with you, because the administration has been talking about this publicly as well," he said. "The bottom line is that the administration is planning to take Venezuelan oil indefinitely and sell it on the secondary market, use that money to run the Venezuelan economy."
>
> "The Venezuelan people don't get to say, we're going to sell that oil, we're going to get that money, and then the United States of America is going to decide who gets paid and who doesn't get paid inside Venezuela," Murphy explained. "We're going to micromanage Venezuela, and we're going to use your taxpayer dollars to do it, because this is going to be a multi-billion dollar effort, which is going to take money, your money, but also enormous time. Donald Trump, the White House, everybody there is going to be spending just as much time running Venezuela as they are running America."
>
> Outside of the abject immorality of this kind of piracy, this plan does a grave disservice to the American people who deserve to have their needs prioritized over those of massive corporations. Once again, we see Trump bending over backwards to help the oligarchs at our expense.
>
> "That's terrible news for you, for the American taxpayer, because there's huge problems here at home," said Murphy. "Healthcare premiums going up, prices going up, and now the United States government is going to be spending most of its time on many days running the country of Venezuela. Why is it also bad news? Because we've seen this play before."
>
> "When the United States tries to impose a political reality at gunpoint on a foreign country, it never goes well," he continued. "Okay, this is a little different than Iraq and Afghanistan, because for now we don't have 100,000 troops on the ground in Venezuela, but it's the same principle. The United States military using its power to try to change a political reality on the ground in a country that we don't understand, it won't go well."
>
> "Another reason why you should care, there's going to be a lot of problems that get greased here, because now we are in charge of the Venezuelan oil industry, essentially," he went on. "And guess what? It's going to be Donald Trump's energy industry and Wall Street friends who are going to get rich off of that. So there is corruption, there is a failure to learn lessons, and there is going to be an enormous amount of time, money, and energy spent on the country of Venezuela instead of the country of the United States of America."
>
> "Donald Trump lied to you when he told you if you elected him, he was going to keep us out of foreign wars, and he was going to focus on costs. He's doing exactly the opposite. He is getting us into another foreign entanglement involving the United States military, and he's doing nothing about the things that matter to you, like costs," Murphy concluded.
>
> Please ❤️ and share to thank Senator Murphy for exposing the truth!

>
> A few hours of sleep deprivation reduces insulin sensitivity and impairs cognitive function.
>
> But just 10 minutes of HIIT can enhance brain blood flow, cognitive performance, and blood glucose regulation. It can take you back to baseline, or even above it, for several hours or until you can get adequate sleep.
>
> You may not feel like going hard when you're tired, but the short-term benefits are real. Just don't make poor sleep a habit.

## @RituWithAI - Socratic Mode for Code Agents

> When you jump straight to Write Code, the agent is operating on a "cold boot" of understanding. It guesses which files matter. By asking questions first ("Where is the auth logic defined?", "How does X abstract connect to Y?"), you force the model to retrieve and index the relevant dependencies before it tries to generate solutions. It changes the probability distribution of the output from a "Probable Guess" to a "Context-Aware Fact."

In a year-long trial, older adults who did aerobic exercise (~65–70% max heart rate, 3x/week for 30 minutes) increased hippocampal volume by about 2%, instead of the usual 1–2% yearly shrinkage. This net gain reflects neurogenesis driven in part by higher BDNF, a key protein that supports the growth and survival of new neurons. The same group also showed improvements in learning and memory, underscoring how powerful regular physical activity is for the aging brain.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/fmfclips/status/2008583243839193239
- **What:** Research demonstrating that moderate aerobic exercise (30 min, 3x/week) can reverse hippocampal volume loss in aging, with improvements in learning and memory tied to elevated BDNF levels.
## @SciTechera - 40-Hz Sound Stimulation Shows Alzheimer's Effects in Aged Monkeys

> Another crazy breakthrough. 40-Hz sound stimulation shows long lasting Alzheimer's effects in aged monkeys. Researchers in China tested whether 40-Hz auditory stimulation could influence Alzheimer's related pathology in aged rhesus monkeys (26–31 years old), a primate model closer to humans than mice. The monkeys were exposed to a 1-kHz pure tone modulated at 40 Hz, 1 hour per day for 7 days. After treatment, levels of β-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased sharply: Aβ42 rose by ~205% and Aβ40 by ~201%. About five weeks later, these elevated levels remained stable, suggesting a sustained biological effect rather than a short term response. The researchers interpret the rise in CSF amyloid as a possible sign of enhanced clearance of amyloid from the brain, not increased production. The study supports the idea that non-invasive 40 Hz sensory stimulation could be a low risk, drug free approach to modulating Alzheimer's disease processes, though human trials are still needed to confirm benefit.

## @drwilliamwallac - Master Clock: How the Brain Controls Your Daily Rhythms

> Your body has a master clock hidden deep in the brain, and it quietly controls almost everything you feel during the day. This chart shows what that clock is actually doing, and why your sleep, hunger, hormones, energy, and mood follow the same 24-hour rhythm every single day. Here's the simple breakdown: The "master clock" lives in the "SCN" (as its abbreviated) Located in the hypothalamus, it takes in light from your eyes and uses it to reset your entire system. Light in the morning tells your brain: wake up, raise cortisol, increase alertness. Darkness at night flips the switch: make melatonin, lower body temperature, prepare for sleep. Melatonin rises only when the SCN says it's dark. The pineal gland releases melatonin to start the sleep process. If light hits your eyes at night (phones, TVs, bright LEDs), that signal can shut off or slow down. Serotonin and melatonin are linked. During the day, serotonin helps regulate mood and alertness. At night, the system converts part of that serotonin into melatonin to drive sleep timing. Your organs follow the brain's schedule. Every major organ has its own "clock genes," and they all sync to the SCN. That's why timing matters...

## @mgyarmathy_ - What Makes Ralph Work

> Ralph works because it reflects a few things that good engineers do instinctively:
>
> 1. build a mental plan of small incremental steps
> 2. focus on one step at a time
> 3. construct automated feedback loops to verify changes
> 4. continually re-evaluate progress and revise the plan
>
> *Quoting @mattpocockuk:* There's an AI coding approach that lets you run seriously long-running AI agents (hours, days) that ship code while you sleep. I've tried it, and I'm not going back.
>
> It's the Ralph Wiggum approach. Here it is in a nutshell:
>
> Run a coding agent with a clean slate, again and again until a stop condition is met.
>
> The Bash Script
>
> Running ralph involves a single bash script.
>
> 1. Set up a bash for loop that runs a set number of times, let's say 10. You choose a finite number to prevent the agent running infinitely.
> 2. Inside the loop, you get the coding agent (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex etc) to work on a single feature in the repo until that single feature is done. You prompt it to say "if, after implementing, there is no further work to be done, reply with <promise>COMPLETE</promise>."
> 3. Check for <promise>COMPLETE</promise> inside the loop and exit early if it exists.
>
> The Stop Condition
>
> How does the LLM know when to emit <promise>COMPLETE</promise>? There are multiple approaches:
>
> - Raw Prompting: Just pass a very clear stop condition to the prompt inside the bash loop. "The job is complete when X conditions are met"
> - TODO list: Give the agent a TODO list to complete
> - PRD: My preferred approach, explained below
>
> Progress Reports
>
> In your prompt, you MUST tell the agent to commit its work, and append its progress to a local progress.txt file.
>
> Committing its work allows future agents to navigate what was done via the git history.
>
> The progress.txt is a standard long-running agent practice. Feed it in to the agent via the prompt, and use the verb 'append' to make sure it doesn't update previous entries.
>
> Keep CI Green
>
> Each commit MUST pass all tests and types. This means you have to prompt the agent to run typechecks and tests on each commit.
>
> If you don't do this, you're hamstringing future agent runs with bad code, and they'll need to bisect to find bugs. Super nasty.
>
> This means that building really healthy feedback loops is CRITICAL to Ralph's success.
>
> The PRD
>
> Two problems immediately emerge with Ralph.
>
> The first is that the agent picks tasks which are too large. They don't scope the amount of work correctly and they try things which are too ambitious. This means they run out of context window and just end up failing.
>
> The second is that the agent doesn't know when to stop.
>
> To solve this, I use a PRD-based approach that formalizes the work I want Ralph to complete in a list of user stories.
>
> It's a mix of a PRD and a TODO-list, where the PRD is a JSON file of user stories with 'passes: false'.
>
> I then prompt the agent to pick the highest priority feature, and ONLY work on that feature. It then updates the passing status of the relevant PRD item at the end.
>
> This scopes it down extremely effectively, meaning it utilizes only a small part of its context window, and thus isn't swamped by context rot.
>
> Summary
>
> - Bash script
> - JSON-based PRD
> - progress.txt
> - Keep CI green
> - Feedback loops
>
> You'll have an AI coding setup that can ship while you kip.

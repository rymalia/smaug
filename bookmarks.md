## @aakashgupta - Recursive Language Models Beyond Context Windows
> Everyone's missing the real story here. This isn't a "prompting technique." The paper is called Recursive Language Models, not "Recursive Meta-Cognition." And the authors aren't random researchers grinding for citation counts. Omar Khattab created DSPy, which has 31,000+ GitHub stars and changed how people build compound AI systems. Tim Kraska pioneered learned index structures with Jeff Dean at Google and runs MIT's Data Systems and AI Lab. Alex Zhang is a PhD student working at the intersection of both. The actual paper addresses a specific problem: LLMs degrade on long context. The graph shows GPT-5 performance collapsing as input length scales from 2^14 to 2^21 tokens, while RLMs maintain stable performance. They're handling inputs 100x beyond context windows...

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2012033154723561581
- **What:** Deep analysis of the Recursive Language Models paper from MIT researchers, explaining how RLMs solve long-context degradation by allowing models to interact with their own prompts as manipulable objects, extending DSPy's research arc.

## @newstart_2024 - Parenting and Genetics Research
> Dr. Russell Barkley shatters parenting myths: After age 21, home parenting has ZERO influence on core traits like personality or behavior—twin studies prove it.

Peak impact? Before 7. Drops to ~6% by teens (15+). Genetics rules first, then peers/schools/neighborhoods take over.

In 2026's "gentle parenting" era (trending amid debates on over-involvement vs. heritability), this frees you: Nail early years with stability/exposure, then trust the blueprint.

Not guilt—empowerment. Grok can even help analyze family traits for smarter guidance.

59-sec clip on the data 👇

Parents/kids: Relief or rethink? What's your take on genetics vs. nurture wars?

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/newstart_2024/status/2012031149921423364
- **What:** Summary of Russell Barkley's research on parenting impact and heritability. Key finding: parental influence is strongest before age 7 (then drops to 6% by teen years), while genetics and peer/social environment dominate behavioral outcomes in adulthood.

## @PaulSolt - 7 Codex Beginner Tips
> 👋 If you're new to Codex, here are 7 beginner tips:

1. Start with:

GPT-5.2-Codex high

That is high reasoning. It is enough. Don't be tempted with xhigh unless working on something really tricky. It uses more tokens and will be slower to finish.

2. Sometimes more reasoning may not help. You may need to give your agents better docs that are up to date. I prefer to have my agents create Markdown docs from DocSet that are local, instead of web scraping.

I use DocSetQuery to create docs from Dash DocSet bundles. https://t.co/WzwVVXKvrv

3. Read @steipete post to get started.

Bookmark his blog and follow him. Read his post, it's gold, and so are his other workflow posts.

https://t.co/uElhPUq7wv

4. Copy aspects from Peter's agents .md file and make it your own. There's thousands of hours of learnings in his open source projects.

https://t.co/j4vPqVbZuQ

Use the scripts too, things like committer for atomic commits are super powerful when multiple agents work in one folder.

5. Just talk to codex. You don't need complex rules. You don't need to create huge Plan .md  files.

You can get really good results by just working on one aspect of a feature at a time, handing it off, and then letting Codex do it.

If you get bored waiting start up another project while you wait. Ask it to do something and then go back to the original one. Most likely it will be done unless you're doing a huge refactor.

6. You can always ask your agent to copy something from another project. Peter does this all the time and has agents leveraging work they've already done for new projects.

I ask my agents to create Makefiles to build and run my apps. For new projects I have them copy the structure. See my workflow video: How I use Codex GPT 5.2 with Xcode (My Complete Workflow)
https://t.co/n8wrm9jmOm

7. Ask it to do things … and most likely you're going to need YOLO (danger mode) to get anything done without constant nagging.

Enjoy your next app!

## @frankdilo - Keeping a Work Log with Claude Code Integration
> You should keep a worklog.

A worklog is a record of what you work on day by day. I decided to keep it in the form of one markdown file per day, in a repository, connected to Claude Code. I have been keeping one for the past couple of years.

During the day, I throw stuff at Claude and it translates into nice and tidy bullet points that are human-readable. At the end of the day, I share this on a # progress Slack channel with the team so everyone is up to speed with everyone else.

It keeps you accountable and it's great for keeping track of what you do day to day and week to week and see if it matches your bigger plan.

I also have a /checkpoint command that summarizes my progress since last week and creates a markdown file.

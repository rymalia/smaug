## @TrungTPhan - How Netflix Changed Filmmaking: Insights from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
> Matt Damon and Ben Affleck on Rogan taking about how Netflix has changed filmmaking.
>
> A major considerations is dealing with distracted viewers. To keep them tuned in, "you re-iterate the plot 3-4x in the dialogue because people are on their phones."
>
> Then, in action films, you change the ordering of climatic fights.
>
> In traditional action films, you'd have "three set pieces" in every act (I, II, III) and each would "ramp up" (spend the big money on third set piece).
>
> But streaming has to hook viewers within 5 minute, so the incentive is to put a major battle or action sequence much earlier.
>
> Also, the directors have less incentive to make a film look great because so many people watch on laptops and phones.
>
> They do say that streaming allows for more bets on risky projects since the theatre economics are geared towards IP, sequels and super-heroes.
>
> Example: an independent film with a $25m budget would spend $25m on marketing (1:1 ratio). But since it splits box office with the theatre, the film needs to make $100m (1/2 of which is $50m) just to break even.
>
> They're realistic about the state of film and call it a supply-demand issue. If the demand is for at-home viewing (eg. Netflix 300m+ subs), then filmmaking approach will change to feed the algo.
>
> When there's demand for theatre, Damon will go team up with Christopher Nolan to make "The Odyssey".

> Agent coding life hack:

Claude Opus 4.5 LOVES it when you ask for its personal opinion on tooling: basically, what it would want if it got to be in charge of making a tool for its own use. 

I'm working on such a tool now for managing processes on a machine (process_triage) and already have a lot fleshed out in a plan document, but decided to ask Claude this:

"OK, without changing the plan document, what do you think would make this project better? What would make it more useful SPECIFICALLY TO YOU if you had to manage one or more linux machines using ssh for optimal performance?  Use ultrathink"

Claude's response is below, but before I paste that whole thing in, here's the next prompt I used to tell it to integrate the suggestions effectively:

"Wonderful. Please carefully make ALL the revisions, additions, expansions, etc. to the document, but in a super cohesive and coherent way, where they are artfully woven into the existing structure and not just dumped into some awful appendix.  Use ultrathink"

PS: Notice how it "desperately want[s]" these feature. Bet you didn't realize your clankers had desires, especially of the "desperate" kind!

## @414magyarbirds - Update from Magyar:
> Update from Magyar:
(On the growth of middle and deep strikes and the slowdown in enemy manpower elimination – the reason and the next move)

The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white in January – it wants to live, even while coming with occupation intentions.

The counter reads: we crossed the 4,200-worm mark over two weeks in January. In 14 days, the USF Birds wiped out the full assault strength of 10 enemy battalions – or the entire infantry of a bit more than three regiments, down to the root. 
That’s not enough, motherfucker. Not enough.

The detox pace is slowed by a third compared to the same period in December – back then, in 14 days, the Birds pecked down over 6,000 carcasses.

The main reason has nothing to do with any drop in the Birds’ combat capability. On the contrary, we’re scaling up – 12,877 enemy targets logged as of the morning of January 15 in the USF Counter. Plenty of fat targets deep in the swamps (already over a hundred), 17 SAM/RADAR units on the air-defense tally, 963 aerial targets (recon wings, Shaheds), 571 enemy pilot launch sites, over 200 guns, 25 SPGs, 42 tanks, 36 AFVs, close to 1,000 units of logistics vehicles, and so on…

But the share of sung-off enemy manpower has dropped. The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white, it’s not switching on Jackie-Chan mode, it weighs every assault, it’s slowed down hard – and that’s noticeable.

On top of that, it’s patching the holes in reinforcements after the December blowout – that was the first time the “arrived/left” balance was confirmed at zero: drones alone pulled 33,000 worms out of the war, exactly as many as the bunker grandpa throws in every month.

In January, that balance will be tougher by about ten thousand, which means more work under pressure in spring. So let’s work, dear Birds, steadily and nonstop, focusing exactly on infantry and worm pilots.

And the oil pour-houses and power sockets in the swamps will keep getting lit in growing numbers – that’s beyond doubt. Together with air defense, of course.

Track the USF results on scoreboard “PIDRAKHUIKA”

## @jaimefjorge - AI-Native Software Engineering and Ralph Loop Insights

> The biggest takeaways/nuggets from my interview with @GeoffreyHuntley on AI-native software engineering and the Ralph loop:
>
> 1. Software development and software engineering are now two different professions, and one of them is over. Software development, the work of translating tickets into code, can now be done by anyone for $10-42/hour while they sleep. Software engineering, architecture, security, requirements breakdown, understanding failure modes, is where humans still matter. If you identify as a "software developer," you're competing against a bash loop. If you identify as a "software engineer," your job is to orchestrate the loops.
>
> 2. The moat you think protects your software product doesn't exist anymore. Geoffrey argues you can clone any SaaS product, even those with BSL licenses or proprietary enterprise code, using AI. He ran Ralph in reverse on HashiCorp Nomad's source code to generate clean-room specifications. When he hit gaps from missing enterprise features, he ran Ralph over their marketing materials and product docs to fill them in. Any company relying on licensing or code secrecy as a competitive moat needs to rethink their strategy.
>
> 3. Cursor, Windsurf, and every other AI coding tool are essentially the same thing: a loop that automatically copies and pastes. Geoffrey built these tools professionally and says the harness does almost nothing; the model does all the work. There's no real moat in the harness business when you're reselling tokens. The only differentiator is taste and UX. Stop evaluating tools and start learning the underlying patterns.
>
> 4. Ralph is not a product. It's an orchestrator pattern for running thousands of AI loops. The simplest version is a bash loop that deterministically allocates memory, lets the LLM pick one task, executes it, then starts fresh. The key insight: every loop gets a brand new context window. You avoid compaction (where the AI gets dumber as context fills up) by never letting the context window accumulate competing goals. Your institutional knowledge lives in specification files, not in the context window.
>
> 5. Specifications are the new source code. Geoffrey's workflow: spend 30 minutes in conversation with AI, drilling into requirements, making engineering decisions, building up specs. Then throw those specs to Ralph and get weeks worth of work in hours. The specs act as a "pin" that reframes every fresh loop with your domain knowledge. He doesn't hand-write specs. He code-generates them through structured conversation. Prototypes are now free. Refactoring is cheap.
>
> 6. The entry-level path into software engineering is closing fast. Geoffrey's company stopped hiring juniors for a year until they figured out how to interview for AI-native skills. There's already a cohort of juniors who've been practicing these techniques for six months. They'll work at a quarter of senior wages and outship them. If you're just picking up these tools today, you're behind. The new interview question: can you explain how to build a coding agent on a whiteboard?
>
> 7. Senior engineers who refuse to adapt are in more danger than juniors who embrace it. Geoffrey sees respected engineers taking hardline stances against AI ("it's installing fascism in your codebase"). Meanwhile, leadership teams are discovering Ralph and realizing three people can run the output of an entire org. When commit velocity and product velocity diverge that dramatically between adopters and non-adopters, founders notice. The hard line is coming.
>
> 8. AI is an amplifier of operator skill, not a replacement for it. If you're great at security and you get good at AI, you become a weapon. If you're mediocre and you use AI, you're still mediocre, just faster. The skill gap comes from "discoveries": learning the tricks, the loop-backs, the ways to close the automation loop. These techniques don't have standardized language yet. We're inventing the terms for the new computer every day.
>
> 9. Open source may no longer make sense for most use cases. Geoffrey, a former prominent open source maintainer whose land was funded by Open Collective, no longer uses open source libraries. His reasoning: every dependency injects a human into the loop. If there's a bug, you open a PR, chase a maintainer, wait. That's not automation. Instead, code-generate what you need. The exception: don't generate cryptography or security-critical code unless you have the domain expertise to verify it.
>
> 10. Programming languages now have a tier list based on how well AI agents can work with them. S-tier: Rust, TypeScript (especially with Effect.js), Python with Pydantic. These are source-based with strong type systems that reject invalid generations and work well with ripgrep for code discovery. F-tier: Java and .NET. Their DLL-based dependency systems don't work natively with the search tools AI agents use. The tradeoff with Rust: compilation is slow, so bad generations cost more time.
>
> 11. Corporate AI transformation programs are dangerously slow. Three-to-four-year rollouts with coaches and committees won't cut it when three founders in Bali can Ralph your entire product and undercut your pricing by 99%. Smaller teams ship faster. By the time the transformation is done, the market has moved. Geoffrey calls this the "Titanic moment": the boat is full, get the next boat.
>
> 12. We have a new computer, and that's why the legends are coming out of retirement. The last 40 years of computing decisions were designed for humans: TTYs, environment variables, slow language evolution to avoid breaking mental models. Now we have robots. What's the bare minimum a robot needs? Geoffrey sees this as the most exciting time in computing. If you're not excited about what you can now build, you haven't truly picked up the new computer yet.

## @Tendar - NATO Response Strategy to Russian Oreshnik Missile Strike

> The use of the Oreshnik was a predictably weak Russian gambit and it is easily explained. Russians are absolutely desperate. The situation for them is getting out of control, across the globe. Their allies and their power are disappearing on a huge scale.
>
> This strike is another attempt to influence Western decision-makers. Russians lost virtually all control to actively change the situation on the ground, except their complete withdrawal. Of course, they can continue their costly meat waves, but the front is basically static. They will not come anywhere near to a satisfying point in the coming years, and they know that they don't have the stomach for it.
>
> But the Russian stunt must not be unanswered, either. Firing ballistic missiles designed only for nuclear warheads especially so close to the Polish respectively NATO border, demands a proper response. Western militaries must always assume that this kind of projectiles are armed and countermeasures in place.
>
> The proper response would for European nations to close all air space in Western Ukraine and deploy air defense assets as well as fighter jets in this sector. This precedence created by Russia not only warrants this action, it would completely neutralize Russian scare tactics by having the exact opposite effect of the Russian intent.

## @frankdilo - Keeping a Work Log with Claude Code Integration
> You should keep a worklog.

A worklog is a record of what you work on day by day. I decided to keep it in the form of one markdown file per day, in a repository, connected to Claude Code. I have been keeping one for the past couple of years.

During the day, I throw stuff at Claude and it translates into nice and tidy bullet points that are human-readable. At the end of the day, I share this on a # progress Slack channel with the team so everyone is up to speed with everyone else.

It keeps you accountable and it's great for keeping track of what you do day to day and week to week and see if it matches your bigger plan.

I also have a /checkpoint command that summarizes my progress since last week and creates a markdown file.

## @vkrajacic - Custom C Base Layer for Windows File Explorer

> Sure did! And to be more descriptive, I didn't rewrite it function by function. The reason I chose to write my own base layer is because the programming landscape has changed significantly since the C standard library was written. So instead of using malloc, I use memory arenas backed by VirtualAlloc, length-based strings instead of null-terminated ones, more math functions such as vectors and matices etc. I go into some detail in a BSC talk for those interested. But I probably just need to start writing some more formal material in the form of a blog or something.
> *Replying to @shanselman:* Vjekoslav built a Windows file explorer from scratch. 2.3MB executable. No VC runtime. He threw away the standard library and wrote his own.

## @godofprompt - Ralph Automated Development Framework Explained

> Everyone's hyping Ralph but overcomplicating it. Let me break it down simply.
>
> Ralph is an automated assistant that codes for you while you sleep.
>
> You give it a to-do list, it works through each task one by one, and stops when everything's done.
>
> Here's the concept:
>
> Normally when you use AI to code, it's a back-and-forth conversation.
>
> You ask, it builds, you check, you ask again.
>
> Ralph removes you from that loop.
>
> You define what "finished" looks like upfront, then the AI works through tasks automatically until they all pass.
>
> Why it actually works:
> Each time Ralph runs, it starts with a clean slate (so it doesn't get confused by old context). But before working, it reads notes from previous rounds:
>
> - What was already built
> - What was learned along the way
> - What's still left to do
>
> It's like hiring someone new every morning who reads yesterday's handoff notes before starting work.
>
> If you want to try it:
>
> 1. You need an AI coding tool (like Amp, Claude Code, or Cursor)
> 1. You write out your feature as small tasks. Not "build a login system" but broken down like:
>
> - Add email and password fields
> - Check if email is valid
> - Show error message when login fails
>
> 1. You run the script and let it loop through each task
> 1. Ralph marks each task complete when it passes your tests, then moves to the next one
>
> Real tips that actually matter:
>
> Each task should take under 5 minutes for the AI. If you're writing a task description longer than 3 sentences, it's too big. Split it.
>
> Your acceptance criteria needs to be stupidly specific. "User can log in" will fail. "Email field exists, password field exists, submit button triggers auth function, error displays on wrong password" will work.
>
> Ralph gets smarter as it goes. By task 10, it's learned patterns from tasks 1-9. The progress.txt file compounds knowledge. Don't delete it mid-session.
>
> Watch the first 3 iterations manually. You'll catch bad patterns before they multiply across 20 commits.
>
> Don't use Ralph for: exploring ideas, major rewrites, or anything touching payments/security. It's for well-defined feature work where you already know what "done" means.
>
> Ryan's team shipped 13 tasks in about an hour of compute time. Each iteration ran 2-5 minutes. That's the realistic expectation.
> *Quoting @ryancarson:* Here's a visual of how the Ralph system works...

>
> Any innovation that happens on my end is:

> 2. Teaching others how to do the same
> 3. Improving the ENVIRONMENT (business & LLMs)
> 4. Creating validation systems
> 5. Steering and directing
> 6. REPORTING
>
> Increasingly this will be the case for everyone, imo.
> If you want to code out of the love of the craft, I think there's space to do so, if you're working at a top 0.1% company maybe you should do so.
>
> For everyone else, startups, staff engineers, etc.. no one cares about the code. They might say they do, but it's a lie.
>
> What matters is:
>
> 1. Product market fit
> 2. Quick iteration to find it
> 3. Satisfying boards, C suite, and customers
> 4. Adapting for the future
> 5. Ensuring revenue is generated
>
> Whether this is what should be doesn't matter, this is what is. It would be naive to think otherwise.

## @ShiningScience - Walking Improves Brain Function
> 🧠 Brain scans show that just 40 minutes of walking literally improves brain function.
>
> Which is not great, given how sedentary modern humans have become — at least in the US and much of Europe.
>
> Research into cognitive performance reveals a stark contrast between sitting still and active movement.
>
> While a sedentary state shows minimal neural activity, light walking immediately ignites neural pathways, significantly boosting focus and creativity. These brain scans prove that movement isn't just about fitness—it is a vital tool for unlocking mental clarity and sharper thinking in our daily lives.
>
> The implications for our cities are profound.
>
> Car-dependent urban design traps us in sedentary cycles, fueling global rises in obesity and cardiovascular disease. However, by redesigning our communities to be walkable and bike-friendly, we can bake health into our daily routines. Prioritizing pedestrian infrastructure over vehicle traffic doesn't just clear the air; it builds stronger communities and healthier minds, proving that the way we design our world determines how well we live in it.

> A recent study published in Annals of Neurology (PMID: 39927551) reveals that low levels of active Vitamin B12 (holotranscobalamin) are linked to reduced white matter integrity and poorer cognitive performance, while total B12 levels may not accurately reflect brain health.

Vitamin B12 is crucial for maintaining nerve function, brain health, and DNA synthesis. It exists in two forms:

- Active B12 (Holotranscobalamin): The bioavailable form directly utilized by cells.
- Inactive B12 (Haptocorrin-bound): Circulates in the bloodstream but is not available for cellular functions.

Traditional blood tests measure total B12, which includes both active and inactive forms, potentially masking deficiencies that could impact cognitive function.

Findings:

- Participants with low active B12 showed significant white matter breakdown and impaired cognitive function compared to those with adequate levels.
- The study demonstrates the importance of measuring active B12 for accurate brain health assessment.

This study highlights the need for a paradigm shift in Vitamin B12 testing and supplementation, emphasizing active B12 as a critical biomarker for brain health and cognitive function.

In the United States, Vitamin B12 deficiency is defined as a blood level below 148 pmol/L. The American Society for Nutrition criticized this approach, highlighting that over 5% of patients with symptoms of B12 deficiency and who respond to B12 supplementation have blood levels above this threshold. Studies suggest that B-vitamin supplementation benefits individuals with clinical signs of deficiency, regardless of their measured blood levels.

## @louisanicola_ - Your Gut Is Running Your Brain
> Your Gut Is Running Your Brain

Your gut is not just about digestion.
It’s shaping your brain, behavior, and future health. 

Here’s what science just proved 

1. The gut–brain axis is real and powerful
• Gut nerves, hormones, immune cells, and bacteria talk directly to your brain
• This affects mood, cravings, inflammation, and cognition

2.  Inflammation can start in the gut and end in the brain
• New studies show gut immune cells can migrate to the brain
• Result: neuroinflammation and brain damage in disease models

3.  Gut bacteria can fight brain diseases
• A protein from H. pylori blocks toxic amyloid buildup
• This matters for Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Type 2 diabetes

4.  GLP-1 drugs are more than “weight loss meds”
• Drugs like semaglutide and tirzepatide reduce body and brain inflammation
• Benefits seen in diabetes, obesity, heart failure, kidney disease, and addiction

5.  New gut hormone drugs are exploding
• Pills and injections now combine GLP-1, amylin, GIP, glucagon
• Some work monthly, some orally, some hit the brain harder

6.  Alzheimer’s prevention may start in the gut
• Early trials show slower brain shrinkage and cognitive decline
• Biggest flaw: treatment starts too late, prevention is the real target

7.  This is a public health issue, not a luxury trend
• 12% of US adults already use GLP-1 drugs
• Access, cost, and prevention policy matter more than hype

If governments can subsidize late-stage disease care, they should invest earlier in gut-driven prevention, metabolic health, and brain longevity. Ignoring this science is a policy failure, not a budget issue.

We’ve spent decades treating the brain last.

Science is saying treat the gut first.

## @doesdatmaksense - Context Compression in Agents: Markdown Files as Memory
> *Quoting @cursor_ai:* Learn about how we use the filesystem to improve context efficiency for tools, MCP servers, skills, terminals, chat history, and more.

everyone building or seriously using agents knows by now that context compression is lossy

agents are good at filesystems, which is why saving conversations as markdown files turns out to be the most reliable approach

i have found this flow to work the best for me. once i am about to hit the context limit, i start a new session and explicitly ask the agent to refer to the main session's markdown file for grounded context. whenever the agent needs elevant context that was discussed in the main session about the scope, failures, or certain decisions, it can just search the markdown file and pull in only the relevant fragments. that way, we are also saving on the tokens and only bringing context that's relevant.

i guess the bet with @specstoryai around conversations-as-artifacts is working perfectly now. probably this is the correct abstraction for long-running, agent-assisted development.

## @JohnHolbein1 - Meta Hid Facebook Mental Health Research Findings
> In a 2020 research project code-named "Project Mercury," scientists worked with survey firm Nielsen to gauge the effect of "deactivating" Facebook, according to Meta documents obtained via discovery.
>
> To the company's disappointment, "people who stopped using Facebook for a week reported lower feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness and social comparison," internal documents said.
>
> Rather than publishing those findings or pursuing additional research, the filing states, Meta called off further work and internally declared that the negative study findings were tainted by the "existing media narrative" around the company.
>
> *Quoting @jayvanbavel:* "Meta shut down internal research into the mental health effects of Facebook after finding causal evidence that its products harmed users' mental health"

## @Microinteracti1 - Congressional Authority on Military Action

>
> Representative Ted Lieu just drew a crystal clear red line, and it matters more than most people seem to realize.
>
> "If any military member, from the generals on down, participates in using force against Greenland without congressional authorization, they are following illegal orders."
>
> That is not rhetoric. That is the law. And he is putting everyone on notice.
>
> This is how a constitutional system is supposed to work. Civilian control. Congressional authority. No freelance militarism because a president feels impulsive or humiliated or bored. Orders that violate the Constitution are not orders. They are illegal commands, and obedience is not a defense.
>
> What I like here is the timing. This is not said after the damage is done. It is a preemptive warning. A flare shot into the sky saying: think very carefully before you cross this line.
>
> For years, too many people in Washington treated norms as vibes and laws as suggestions. This is a reminder that the system still has teeth if people are willing to use them. And that responsibility does not magically disappear when you put on a uniform.
>
> More of this please. Clear boundaries. Plain language. Zero ambiguity. That is how you stop bad ideas before they turn into irreversible disasters.

## @OccupyDemocrats - Trump Administration Venezuela Oil Seizure Plan
> BREAKING: Senator Chris Murphy pulls back the curtain on Trump's "insane" plans for Venezuela after a classified briefing — and it's so much worse than we thought.
>
> Every American has a right to know this...
>
> "I just came from the administration briefing on Venezuela," Murphy said in a video posted to X. "Obviously, I can't talk to you about the details they shared on the operation itself, but they did talk about their plan moving forward to run Venezuela, and it's insane. They are essentially asking you, the American public, to use your taxpayer dollars to run the country of Venezuela."
>
> Trumped promised to put America first. Instead, he's violating international law and kidnapping foreign leaders in order to shovel even more profits to oil companies as average Americans sink deeper into economic suffering.
>
> "It will be an enormous distraction from everything that matters, because Venezuela has never posed a direct threat to the United States, and it threatens to repeat almost all of the mistakes we made in Iraq and Afghanistan," Murphy continued.
>
> "So let me tell you what I learned, and I can share this with you, because the administration has been talking about this publicly as well," he said. "The bottom line is that the administration is planning to take Venezuelan oil indefinitely and sell it on the secondary market, use that money to run the Venezuelan economy."
>
> "The Venezuelan people don't get to say, we're going to sell that oil, we're going to get that money, and then the United States of America is going to decide who gets paid and who doesn't get paid inside Venezuela," Murphy explained. "We're going to micromanage Venezuela, and we're going to use your taxpayer dollars to do it, because this is going to be a multi-billion dollar effort, which is going to take money, your money, but also enormous time. Donald Trump, the White House, everybody there is going to be spending just as much time running Venezuela as they are running America."
>
> Outside of the abject immorality of this kind of piracy, this plan does a grave disservice to the American people who deserve to have their needs prioritized over those of massive corporations. Once again, we see Trump bending over backwards to help the oligarchs at our expense.
>
> "That's terrible news for you, for the American taxpayer, because there's huge problems here at home," said Murphy. "Healthcare premiums going up, prices going up, and now the United States government is going to be spending most of its time on many days running the country of Venezuela. Why is it also bad news? Because we've seen this play before."
>
> "When the United States tries to impose a political reality at gunpoint on a foreign country, it never goes well," he continued. "Okay, this is a little different than Iraq and Afghanistan, because for now we don't have 100,000 troops on the ground in Venezuela, but it's the same principle. The United States military using its power to try to change a political reality on the ground in a country that we don't understand, it won't go well."
>
> "Another reason why you should care, there's going to be a lot of problems that get greased here, because now we are in charge of the Venezuelan oil industry, essentially," he went on. "And guess what? It's going to be Donald Trump's energy industry and Wall Street friends who are going to get rich off of that. So there is corruption, there is a failure to learn lessons, and there is going to be an enormous amount of time, money, and energy spent on the country of Venezuela instead of the country of the United States of America."
>
> "Donald Trump lied to you when he told you if you elected him, he was going to keep us out of foreign wars, and he was going to focus on costs. He's doing exactly the opposite. He is getting us into another foreign entanglement involving the United States military, and he's doing nothing about the things that matter to you, like costs," Murphy concluded.

## @Dr_Singularity - 40-Hz Sound Therapy for Alzheimer's
> wow
>
> Researchers gave aged rhesus monkeys daily one hour sessions of 40-Hz auditory stimulation (a low-frequency sound) for a week.
>
> In the monkeys, levels of Alzheimer's related β-amyloid proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid more than doubled, and this increase persisted for over five weeks after treatment, suggesting that 40-Hz sound stimulation could help the brain clear toxic proteins and might be a promising noninvasive therapy for Alzheimer's disease.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/Dr_Singularity/status/2009025233387233635

> The brain consumes ~20% of the body’s energy (it can be up to 50% around the age of 10).
> 
> Its function, no surprise, depends on consistent metabolism and micronutrient availability
> 
> 1) Homocysteine control
> B6, B9 (folate), B12, riboflavin, choline, and niacin regulate homocysteine. Elevated levels are associated with vascular dysfunction and neurodegeneration.
> 
> 2) Mitochondrial energy metabolism
> B vitamins, lipoic acid, CoQ10, iron, and manganese act as enzyme cofactors in oxidative phosphorylation. Thiamine or riboflavin deficiency directly impairs cerebral ATP generation.
> 3) Neurotransmitter synthesis
> Vitamin B6 is required to synthesize serotonin, dopamine, and GABA from amino acids. Inadequate B6 disrupts excitatory–inhibitory balance and stress regulation.
> 
> 4) Nerve signal transmission
> DHA, folate, B12, thiamine, and iron support myelin integrity and axonal conduction, enabling efficient action potential propagation.
> 5) Neuronal membrane stability
> DHA and EPA form the structural backbone of neuronal membranes. Vitamins C and E, along with polyphenols, protect these lipids from oxidative damage.
> 
> 6) Neuronal growth and plasticity
> Vitamin D and flavonoids influence gene expression involved in synaptic remodeling, learning, and memory.
> 7) Cerebral blood flow
> Polyphenols improve endothelial function and cerebral perfusion, supporting oxygen and nutrient delivery to active neurons.

## @RituWithAI - Socratic Mode for Code Agents

> When you jump straight to Write Code, the agent is operating on a "cold boot" of understanding. It guesses which files matter. By asking questions first ("Where is the auth logic defined?", "How does X abstract connect to Y?"), you force the model to retrieve and index the relevant dependencies before it tries to generate solutions. It changes the probability distribution of the output from a "Probable Guess" to a "Context-Aware Fact."

## @fmfclips - Aerobic Exercise Reverses Brain Aging in Older Adults

> Exercise doesn't just slow brain aging, it can reverse it. In a year-long trial, older adults who did aerobic exercise (~65–70% max heart rate, 3x/week for 30 minutes) increased hippocampal volume by about 2%, instead of the usual 1–2% yearly shrinkage. This net gain reflects neurogenesis driven in part by higher BDNF, a key protein that supports the growth and survival of new neurons. The same group also showed improvements in learning and memory, underscoring how powerful regular physical activity is for the aging brain.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/fmfclips/status/2008583243839193239

## @SciTechera - 40-Hz Sound Stimulation Shows Alzheimer's Effects in Aged Monkeys

> Another crazy breakthrough. 40-Hz sound stimulation shows long lasting Alzheimer's effects in aged monkeys. Researchers in China tested whether 40-Hz auditory stimulation could influence Alzheimer's related pathology in aged rhesus monkeys (26–31 years old), a primate model closer to humans than mice. The monkeys were exposed to a 1-kHz pure tone modulated at 40 Hz, 1 hour per day for 7 days. After treatment, levels of β-amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased sharply: Aβ42 rose by ~205% and Aβ40 by ~201%. About five weeks later, these elevated levels remained stable, suggesting a sustained biological effect rather than a short term response. The researchers interpret the rise in CSF amyloid as a possible sign of enhanced clearance of amyloid from the brain, not increased production. The study supports the idea that non-invasive 40 Hz sensory stimulation could be a low risk, drug free approach to modulating Alzheimer's disease processes, though human trials are still needed to confirm benefit.

## @drwilliamwallac - Master Clock: How the Brain Controls Your Daily Rhythms

> Your body has a master clock hidden deep in the brain, and it quietly controls almost everything you feel during the day. This chart shows what that clock is actually doing, and why your sleep, hunger, hormones, energy, and mood follow the same 24-hour rhythm every single day. Here's the simple breakdown: The "master clock" lives in the "SCN" (as its abbreviated) Located in the hypothalamus, it takes in light from your eyes and uses it to reset your entire system. Light in the morning tells your brain: wake up, raise cortisol, increase alertness. Darkness at night flips the switch: make melatonin, lower body temperature, prepare for sleep. Melatonin rises only when the SCN says it's dark. The pineal gland releases melatonin to start the sleep process. If light hits your eyes at night (phones, TVs, bright LEDs), that signal can shut off or slow down. Serotonin and melatonin are linked. During the day, serotonin helps regulate mood and alertness. At night, the system converts part of that serotonin into melatonin to drive sleep timing. Your organs follow the brain's schedule. Every major organ has its own "clock genes," and they all sync to the SCN. That's why timing matters...

## @mgyarmathy_ - What Makes Ralph Work

> Ralph works because it reflects a few things that good engineers do instinctively:
>
> 1. build a mental plan of small incremental steps
> 2. focus on one step at a time
> 3. construct automated feedback loops to verify changes
> 4. continually re-evaluate progress and revise the plan
>
> *Quoting @mattpocockuk:* There's an AI coding approach that lets you run seriously long-running AI agents (hours, days) that ship code while you sleep. I've tried it, and I'm not going back.
>
> It's the Ralph Wiggum approach. Here it is in a nutshell:
>
> Run a coding agent with a clean slate, again and again until a stop condition is met.
>
> The Bash Script
>
> Running ralph involves a single bash script.
>
> 1. Set up a bash for loop that runs a set number of times, let's say 10. You choose a finite number to prevent the agent running infinitely.
> 2. Inside the loop, you get the coding agent (Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex etc) to work on a single feature in the repo until that single feature is done. You prompt it to say "if, after implementing, there is no further work to be done, reply with <promise>COMPLETE</promise>."
> 3. Check for <promise>COMPLETE</promise> inside the loop and exit early if it exists.
>
> The Stop Condition
>
> How does the LLM know when to emit <promise>COMPLETE</promise>? There are multiple approaches:
>
> - Raw Prompting: Just pass a very clear stop condition to the prompt inside the bash loop. "The job is complete when X conditions are met"
> - TODO list: Give the agent a TODO list to complete
> - PRD: My preferred approach, explained below
>
> Progress Reports
>
> In your prompt, you MUST tell the agent to commit its work, and append its progress to a local progress.txt file.
>
> Committing its work allows future agents to navigate what was done via the git history.
>
> The progress.txt is a standard long-running agent practice. Feed it in to the agent via the prompt, and use the verb 'append' to make sure it doesn't update previous entries.
>
> Keep CI Green
>
> Each commit MUST pass all tests and types. This means you have to prompt the agent to run typechecks and tests on each commit.
>
> If you don't do this, you're hamstringing future agent runs with bad code, and they'll need to bisect to find bugs. Super nasty.
>
> This means that building really healthy feedback loops is CRITICAL to Ralph's success.
>
> The PRD
>
> Two problems immediately emerge with Ralph.
>
> The first is that the agent picks tasks which are too large. They don't scope the amount of work correctly and they try things which are too ambitious. This means they run out of context window and just end up failing.
>
> The second is that the agent doesn't know when to stop.
>
> To solve this, I use a PRD-based approach that formalizes the work I want Ralph to complete in a list of user stories.
>
> It's a mix of a PRD and a TODO-list, where the PRD is a JSON file of user stories with 'passes: false'.
>
> I then prompt the agent to pick the highest priority feature, and ONLY work on that feature. It then updates the passing status of the relevant PRD item at the end.
>
> This scopes it down extremely effectively, meaning it utilizes only a small part of its context window, and thus isn't swamped by context rot.
>
> Summary
>
> - Bash script
> - JSON-based PRD
> - progress.txt
> - Keep CI green
> - Feedback loops
>
> You'll have an AI coding setup that can ship while you kip.

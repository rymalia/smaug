## @TheAhmadOsman - Local LLMs 101: Complete Technical Guide
> - local llms 101

> - running a model = inference (using model weights)
> - inference = predicting the next token based on your input plus all tokens generated so far
> - together, these make up the "sequence"
>
> - tokens ≠ words
> - they're the chunks representing the text a model sees
> - they are represented by integers (token IDs) in the model
> - "tokenizer" = the algorithm that splits text into tokens
> - common types: BPE (byte pair encoding), SentencePiece
> - token examples:
> - "hello" = 1 token or maybe 2 or 3 tokens
> - "internationalization" = 5–8 tokens
> - context window = max tokens model can "see" at once (2K, 8K, 32K+)

## @doodlestein - Agent coding life hack:
> Agent coding life hack:

Claude Opus 4.5 LOVES it when you ask for its personal opinion on tooling: basically, what it would want if it got to be in charge of making a tool for its own use. 

I'm working on such a tool now for managing processes on a machine (process_triage) and already have a lot fleshed out in a plan document, but decided to ask Claude this:

"OK, without changing the plan document, what do you think would make this project better? What would make it more useful SPECIFICALLY TO YOU if you had to manage one or more linux machines using ssh for optimal performance?  Use ultrathink"

Claude's response is below, but before I paste that whole thing in, here's the next prompt I used to tell it to integrate the suggestions effectively:

"Wonderful. Please carefully make ALL the revisions, additions, expansions, etc. to the document, but in a super cohesive and coherent way, where they are artfully woven into the existing structure and not just dumped into some awful appendix.  Use ultrathink"

PS: Notice how it "desperately want[s]" these feature. Bet you didn't realize your clankers had desires, especially of the "desperate" kind!

## @414magyarbirds - Update from Magyar:
> Update from Magyar:
(On the growth of middle and deep strikes and the slowdown in enemy manpower elimination – the reason and the next move)

The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white in January – it wants to live, even while coming with occupation intentions.

The counter reads: we crossed the 4,200-worm mark over two weeks in January. In 14 days, the USF Birds wiped out the full assault strength of 10 enemy battalions – or the entire infantry of a bit more than three regiments, down to the root. 
That’s not enough, motherfucker. Not enough.

The detox pace is slowed by a third compared to the same period in December – back then, in 14 days, the Birds pecked down over 6,000 carcasses.

The main reason has nothing to do with any drop in the Birds’ combat capability. On the contrary, we’re scaling up – 12,877 enemy targets logged as of the morning of January 15 in the USF Counter. Plenty of fat targets deep in the swamps (already over a hundred), 17 SAM/RADAR units on the air-defense tally, 963 aerial targets (recon wings, Shaheds), 571 enemy pilot launch sites, over 200 guns, 25 SPGs, 42 tanks, 36 AFVs, close to 1,000 units of logistics vehicles, and so on…

But the share of sung-off enemy manpower has dropped. The worm isn’t in a hurry to crawl red-on-white, it’s not switching on Jackie-Chan mode, it weighs every assault, it’s slowed down hard – and that’s noticeable.

On top of that, it’s patching the holes in reinforcements after the December blowout – that was the first time the “arrived/left” balance was confirmed at zero: drones alone pulled 33,000 worms out of the war, exactly as many as the bunker grandpa throws in every month.

In January, that balance will be tougher by about ten thousand, which means more work under pressure in spring. So let’s work, dear Birds, steadily and nonstop, focusing exactly on infantry and worm pilots.

And the oil pour-houses and power sockets in the swamps will keep getting lit in growing numbers – that’s beyond doubt. Together with air defense, of course.

Track the USF results on scoreboard “PIDRAKHUIKA”

## @akshay_pachaar - Prompt Repetition Improves LLM Performance
> A dead-simple trick to improve LLM performance:

Just repeat your prompt twice.

No fancy prompting techniques, no chain-of-thought, just plain repetition.

Google researchers tested this across Gemini, GPT, Claude, and Deepseek, and the results were surprisingly good.

Here's why it works:

LLMs are causal, meaning tokens can only see what came before them. When you ask a question after providing context, the question tokens never "saw" the full picture.

By repeating the prompt, every token gets to attend to every other token during prefill.

The best part:

- No increase in output length
- No increase in latency
- Works as a simple drop-in replacement

On one task, Gemini Flash-Lite jumped from 21% to 97% accuracy just by repeating the input.

Important note:

This helps most when reasoning is disabled. If you're already using "think step-by-step," the gains are mostly neutral since reasoning models tend to repeat the prompt internally anyway.

Paper: "Prompt Repetition Improves Non-Reasoning LLMs" from Google Research.

Sometimes the simplest ideas win.

Link to the paper in the next tweet.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/akshay_pachaar/status/2011781577794339005
- **What:** Research technique showing that repeating prompts twice can significantly improve LLM accuracy without performance penalty. Particularly effective for non-reasoning models, with some tasks showing improvement from 21% to 97% accuracy.

https://t.co/PZMrmbFVRk

if your name is not geoffrey huntley; do not use loom. everything will change wildly and at almost zero notice via ralph loops. loom is the ralph loop orchestrator that has been in my head for the last year and that i have rebuilt many times over.

the reason i share the code really comes down to by building in the open and it makes it easier for me to teach concepts, ideas and put names on techniques that don't even have words to formally describe them.

nay sayers will say it's not possible to build something with zero code review where agents have sudo to automatically deploy

like yeggie; i'm here to prove them wrong but i'm taking it N steps further.

the last 40 years of computing and software engineering practices were developed for humans. we can invalidate anything.

we have a new computer now.

watch it get build 😎

it'll be easier for folks to pick problems with the codebase as it's now but what i want you to remember - any such issues can be solved with another highly targeted ralph loop and there's many i have yet to do.

it's time to stitch all the components together and build autonomous recursive outcomes.

## @questmoosa - Psoas Muscle: The Connection to Breathing and Stress
> One of the greatest things that you can do today is to strengthen your psoas muscle. It is absolutely imperative and of ut-most importance that this muscle is strengthened daily.

Why is this you ask?

Well, our psoas muscle and diaphragm (the muscle that helps us breathe) are connected through a piece of tissue called FASCIA.

Therefore a weak/tight psoas can increase tension on the diaphragm instantly, resulting in rapid shallow breathing at rest, causing elevated stress levels and loss of perceived beauty.

(Perceived beauty is simply increased fertility and good health - this is why people want to mate with attractive people because they are healthy and fertile)

On the other hand, a strong psoas muscle can reduce tension on the diaphragm, allowing balanced cortisol levels due to deeper slower breathing at rest.

Remember that the more you sit, the weaker your psoas muscle will be.

Exercise your psoas muscle (known as the muscle of the soul) today!

## @aakashgupta - Recursive Language Models Beyond Context Windows
> Everyone's missing the real story here. This isn't a "prompting technique." The paper is called Recursive Language Models, not "Recursive Meta-Cognition." And the authors aren't random researchers grinding for citation counts. Omar Khattab created DSPy, which has 31,000+ GitHub stars and changed how people build compound AI systems. Tim Kraska pioneered learned index structures with Jeff Dean at Google and runs MIT's Data Systems and AI Lab. Alex Zhang is a PhD student working at the intersection of both. The actual paper addresses a specific problem: LLMs degrade on long context. The graph shows GPT-5 performance collapsing as input length scales from 2^14 to 2^21 tokens, while RLMs maintain stable performance. They're handling inputs 100x beyond context windows...

## @newstart_2024 - Parenting and Genetics Research
> Dr. Russell Barkley shatters parenting myths: After age 21, home parenting has ZERO influence on core traits like personality or behavior—twin studies prove it.

Peak impact? Before 7. Drops to ~6% by teens (15+). Genetics rules first, then peers/schools/neighborhoods take over.

In 2026's "gentle parenting" era (trending amid debates on over-involvement vs. heritability), this frees you: Nail early years with stability/exposure, then trust the blueprint.

Not guilt—empowerment. Grok can even help analyze family traits for smarter guidance.

Parents/kids: Relief or rethink? What's your take on genetics vs. nurture wars?

- **What:** Summary of Russell Barkley's research on parenting impact and heritability. Key finding: parental influence is strongest before age 7 (then drops to 6% by teen years), while genetics and peer/social environment dominate behavioral outcomes in adulthood.

## @PaulSolt - 7 Codex Beginner Tips
> 👋 If you're new to Codex, here are 7 beginner tips:

1. Start with:

GPT-5.2-Codex high

That is high reasoning. It is enough. Don't be tempted with xhigh unless working on something really tricky. It uses more tokens and will be slower to finish.

2. Sometimes more reasoning may not help. You may need to give your agents better docs that are up to date. I prefer to have my agents create Markdown docs from DocSet that are local, instead of web scraping.

I use DocSetQuery to create docs from Dash DocSet bundles. https://t.co/WzwVVXKvrv

3. Read @steipete post to get started.

Bookmark his blog and follow him. Read his post, it's gold, and so are his other workflow posts.

https://t.co/uElhPUq7wv

4. Copy aspects from Peter's agents .md file and make it your own. There's thousands of hours of learnings in his open source projects.

https://t.co/j4vPqVbZuQ

Use the scripts too, things like committer for atomic commits are super powerful when multiple agents work in one folder.

5. Just talk to codex. You don't need complex rules. You don't need to create huge Plan .md  files.

You can get really good results by just working on one aspect of a feature at a time, handing it off, and then letting Codex do it.

If you get bored waiting start up another project while you wait. Ask it to do something and then go back to the original one. Most likely it will be done unless you're doing a huge refactor.

6. You can always ask your agent to copy something from another project. Peter does this all the time and has agents leveraging work they've already done for new projects.

I ask my agents to create Makefiles to build and run my apps. For new projects I have them copy the structure. See my workflow video: How I use Codex GPT 5.2 with Xcode (My Complete Workflow)
https://t.co/n8wrm9jmOm

7. Ask it to do things … and most likely you're going to need YOLO (danger mode) to get anything done without constant nagging.

Enjoy your next app!

## @jaimefjorge - AI-Native Software Engineering and Ralph Loop Insights

> The biggest takeaways/nuggets from my interview with @GeoffreyHuntley on AI-native software engineering and the Ralph loop:
>
> 1. Software development and software engineering are now two different professions, and one of them is over. Software development, the work of translating tickets into code, can now be done by anyone for $10-42/hour while they sleep. Software engineering, architecture, security, requirements breakdown, understanding failure modes, is where humans still matter. If you identify as a "software developer," you're competing against a bash loop. If you identify as a "software engineer," your job is to orchestrate the loops.
>
> 2. The moat you think protects your software product doesn't exist anymore. Geoffrey argues you can clone any SaaS product, even those with BSL licenses or proprietary enterprise code, using AI. He ran Ralph in reverse on HashiCorp Nomad's source code to generate clean-room specifications. When he hit gaps from missing enterprise features, he ran Ralph over their marketing materials and product docs to fill them in. Any company relying on licensing or code secrecy as a competitive moat needs to rethink their strategy.
>
> 3. Cursor, Windsurf, and every other AI coding tool are essentially the same thing: a loop that automatically copies and pastes. Geoffrey built these tools professionally and says the harness does almost nothing; the model does all the work. There's no real moat in the harness business when you're reselling tokens. The only differentiator is taste and UX. Stop evaluating tools and start learning the underlying patterns.
>
> 4. Ralph is not a product. It's an orchestrator pattern for running thousands of AI loops. The simplest version is a bash loop that deterministically allocates memory, lets the LLM pick one task, executes it, then starts fresh. The key insight: every loop gets a brand new context window. You avoid compaction (where the AI gets dumber as context fills up) by never letting the context window accumulate competing goals. Your institutional knowledge lives in specification files, not in the context window.
>
> 5. Specifications are the new source code. Geoffrey's workflow: spend 30 minutes in conversation with AI, drilling into requirements, making engineering decisions, building up specs. Then throw those specs to Ralph and get weeks worth of work in hours. The specs act as a "pin" that reframes every fresh loop with your domain knowledge. He doesn't hand-write specs. He code-generates them through structured conversation. Prototypes are now free. Refactoring is cheap.
>
> 6. The entry-level path into software engineering is closing fast. Geoffrey's company stopped hiring juniors for a year until they figured out how to interview for AI-native skills. There's already a cohort of juniors who've been practicing these techniques for six months. They'll work at a quarter of senior wages and outship them. If you're just picking up these tools today, you're behind. The new interview question: can you explain how to build a coding agent on a whiteboard?
>
> 7. Senior engineers who refuse to adapt are in more danger than juniors who embrace it. Geoffrey sees respected engineers taking hardline stances against AI ("it's installing fascism in your codebase"). Meanwhile, leadership teams are discovering Ralph and realizing three people can run the output of an entire org. When commit velocity and product velocity diverge that dramatically between adopters and non-adopters, founders notice. The hard line is coming.
>
> 8. AI is an amplifier of operator skill, not a replacement for it. If you're great at security and you get good at AI, you become a weapon. If you're mediocre and you use AI, you're still mediocre, just faster. The skill gap comes from "discoveries": learning the tricks, the loop-backs, the ways to close the automation loop. These techniques don't have standardized language yet. We're inventing the terms for the new computer every day.
>
> 9. Open source may no longer make sense for most use cases. Geoffrey, a former prominent open source maintainer whose land was funded by Open Collective, no longer uses open source libraries. His reasoning: every dependency injects a human into the loop. If there's a bug, you open a PR, chase a maintainer, wait. That's not automation. Instead, code-generate what you need. The exception: don't generate cryptography or security-critical code unless you have the domain expertise to verify it.
>
> 10. Programming languages now have a tier list based on how well AI agents can work with them. S-tier: Rust, TypeScript (especially with Effect.js), Python with Pydantic. These are source-based with strong type systems that reject invalid generations and work well with ripgrep for code discovery. F-tier: Java and .NET. Their DLL-based dependency systems don't work natively with the search tools AI agents use. The tradeoff with Rust: compilation is slow, so bad generations cost more time.
>
> 11. Corporate AI transformation programs are dangerously slow. Three-to-four-year rollouts with coaches and committees won't cut it when three founders in Bali can Ralph your entire product and undercut your pricing by 99%. Smaller teams ship faster. By the time the transformation is done, the market has moved. Geoffrey calls this the "Titanic moment": the boat is full, get the next boat.
>
> 12. We have a new computer, and that's why the legends are coming out of retirement. The last 40 years of computing decisions were designed for humans: TTYs, environment variables, slow language evolution to avoid breaking mental models. Now we have robots. What's the bare minimum a robot needs? Geoffrey sees this as the most exciting time in computing. If you're not excited about what you can now build, you haven't truly picked up the new computer yet.

## @Rainmaker1973 - Creatine supplementation and cognitive performance

> Creatine, long celebrated for supporting muscle growth and athletic performance, is gaining recognition in neuroscience as a powerful aid for brain energy management—especially under demanding conditions like mental stress, intense cognitive effort, or sleep deprivation.
>
> As the brain's primary energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) gets rapidly depleted during high-demand tasks. Creatine helps by facilitating the quick recycling of ATP through the phosphocreatine system, providing neurons with a more reliable energy buffer to sustain performance when demands spike.
>
> Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials have quantified these effects. A 2024 meta-analysis (Xu et al., Frontiers in Nutrition) found that creatine monohydrate supplementation significantly improved memory performance, with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of 0.31 (95% CI: 0.17–0.44; equivalent to Hedges' g ≈ 0.30), alongside benefits in information processing speed and attention time in some measures...

## @atrupar - Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Statement

News reports simply don't do justice to the level of chaos and disruption and trauma the federal government is raining down upon our communities. They're pulling over people indiscriminately, including US citizens, and demanding to see their papers. At grocery stores, at bus stops, even at our schools, they're breaking windows, dragging pregnant women down the street, just plain grabbing Minnesotans and shoving them into unmarked vans. Kidnapping innocent people with no warning and no due process. Let's be very, very clear. This long ago stopped being a matter of immigration enforcement. Instead, it's a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota by our own federal government. This week, he went online to promise that 'the day of retribution and reckoning is coming.' That's a direct threat against the people of this state who dared to vote against him three times and who continue to stand up for freedom with courage and empathy and profound grace."

## @alexhillman - PRIME Score Rescoring Agent

> Right now it's a separate process because it happens every few days.

> So the score is "living" and always updating. Scores can even go down!
>
> Each time it runs it shows me 3 seeds at random (with rules to avoid dupes).
>
> But it SUGGESTS THE SCORE and why.
>
> I read and approve.
>
> It's recording what I approve, deny, tweak.
>
> Periodically (manually now but eventually on a schedule) it reviews my approval patterns so it can eventually run on its own and just report without my intervention required.

## @aakashgupta - Anthropic Tool Search Reduces MCP Token Usage by 85%

> Anthropic just solved MCP's biggest lie: that 50+ tools means 50+ capabilities.
>
> The math tells a different story. Users with 7 MCP servers were burning 67k tokens before typing a single character. That's 33% of Sonnet's 200k context window gone. One Docker MCP alone consumed 125k tokens with 135 tools.
>
> Tool Search flips the architecture. Instead of preloading every tool definition upfront, Claude Code now loads a search index and pulls tools on-demand. The token savings are dramatic: from ~134k to ~5k in Anthropic's internal testing. That's an 85% reduction while maintaining full tool access.
>
> But here's what makes this actually interesting. They're not just optimizing context usage. They're changing what "tool-rich agents" can mean.
>
> The old constraint forced a brutal tradeoff: either limit your MCP servers to 2-3 core tools, or accept that half your context budget disappears before you start working. Power users documented setups with 7+ servers consuming 67k+ tokens. The GitHub issue tracking this had 97 upvotes. People were building CLI tools just to toggle servers on and off between sessions.
>
> Tool Search reframes the problem. The bottleneck wasn't "too many tools." It was loading tool definitions like 2020-era static imports instead of 2024-era lazy loading. Every IDE figured this out years ago. VSCode doesn't load every extension at startup. JetBrains doesn't inject every plugin's docs into memory. Claude Code was architecturally behind its own ecosystem's best practices.
>
> The accuracy improvement matters more than the token savings. Opus 4 went from 49% to 74% on MCP evals with Tool Search enabled. Opus 4.5 from 79.5% to 88.1%. Fewer tools in context means less confusion between similar tool names like notification-send-user vs notification-send-channel.
>
> This is Anthropic doing infrastructure work that doesn't generate headlines but compounds over time. The MCP ecosystem just got permission to build bigger.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/aakashgupta/status/2011664388424454262
- **What:** Technical deep-dive on Anthropic's Tool Search feature for MCPs (Model Context Protocol). Explains how lazy-loading of tool definitions reduces token consumption from 134k to 5k (85% savings) while improving accuracy from 79.5% to 88.1%, enabling power users to scale tool ecosystems beyond previous limitations.

## @JI - Deep Understanding Required for AI-Assisted Software Engineering

> I use Claude Code on production codebases enough that I hit the max limits. "Vibe coding" does not describe my work.
>
> A deep understanding of software engineering and computer systems is required to make the calls that keep a complex codebase healthy and keep my company's engineering org able to maintain our production apps and services.
>
> LLMs get many details right, but it is also the norm for a few things to be wrong or not aligned with how we think about software engineering. It takes an expert eye to spot which 1 out of 10 outputs needs rework, or is simply wrong. A novice who trusts the LLM's capabilities more than their own judgment will believe all 10.
>
> This is an excerpt from a memo on AI agents I shared with our CRO @joe_d_ryan:
>
> LLMs accept imprecision. You can leave out details of your problem and solution and LLMs will fill in the blanks. They'll often be wrong, but you will get something working end to end, which is valuable to iterate on. But you need to be able to spot gaps and mistakes in your prompts because the LLM will not reliably identify them.
> LLMs create imprecision. You need to be able to spot mistakes in the LLM's outputs, and the LLM cannot always check its own work. You need to already have a vision for the end state and the direction it lies in, and use the LLM to automate getting there faster.
> Experts who understand a problem and are looking to accelerate solving it will be amplified in positive directions, scaling themselves. Novices who trust LLMs will be amplified in negative directions, becoming confident in wrong solutions.
>
> The frontier of what it means to be an expert will change. Experts will need to know how to apply AI and the boundaries of its capabilities. An expert software engineer will need the dexterity to wield a coding agent well. That dexterity will come from experience, intuition, and talent. A senior skill will be getting codebases, teams, and companies to work productively with agents. It has always been a senior skill to set organizations up for success and then achieve it.
>
> Typing source code is mostly dead. We'll still edit a few lines here and there.
>
> Reading, and more importantly understanding, source code is very much alive. We'll do more of this as code is written faster.
>
> The art and science of software engineering are blossoming again. This is not a renaissance; software engineering was never dead and is not being reborn. "Vibe coding" is different. It is something new being born. The dominant change, though, is the industry and discipline of software engineering are evolving more than they have since the internet, if not since the beginning.

- **Tweet:** https://x.com/JI/status/2011207791764283690
- **What:** Deep analysis arguing that Claude Code requires expert-level software engineering judgment to use effectively, not casual "vibe coding". Emphasizes that while LLMs are powerful tools, they require experienced developers to catch errors and guide outcomes. Predicts the future of software engineering will prioritize code reading and architectural thinking over writing.

> *Quoting @GergelyOrosz:* We should stop calling it "vibe coding" when it's software engineers writing production software, paying close attention, thinking a lot, validating before committing, closing the loop… and yes they prompt an agent/work with it. Very different from "let it rip" w 0 validation

## @SkylineReport - ICE Prosecutor Returns to Court Despite Racist Account Exposure

> An ICE prosecutor in Dallas, James Rodden, who was previously exposed for running a white-supremacist X account praising Hitler and calling America a "White nation," is quietly back in immigration court. After the Texas Observer revealed his online activity last year, he was pulled from court schedules and Congress demanded an investigation. Immigration and Customs Enforcement promised a review within 120 days. That deadline blew past with zero public outcome.
>
> Now Rodden has resurfaced at the prosecutor's table, badge on, no explanation given. ICE refuses to comment. The account is still active, just locked. Bottom line: a government lawyer who openly promotes racist ideology appears to be prosecuting immigrants again, with no transparency, no accountability, and no evidence that ICE ever did what it claimed it would do.

## @frankdilo - Keeping a Work Log with Claude Code Integration
> You should keep a worklog.

A worklog is a record of what you work on day by day. I decided to keep it in the form of one markdown file per day, in a repository, connected to Claude Code. I have been keeping one for the past couple of years.

During the day, I throw stuff at Claude and it translates into nice and tidy bullet points that are human-readable. At the end of the day, I share this on a # progress Slack channel with the team so everyone is up to speed with everyone else.

It keeps you accountable and it's great for keeping track of what you do day to day and week to week and see if it matches your bigger plan.

I also have a /checkpoint command that summarizes my progress since last week and creates a markdown file.

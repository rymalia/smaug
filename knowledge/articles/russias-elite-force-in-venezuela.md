## Summary

During the final moments of Maduro's rule, Russian forces that were positioned to protect him simply disappeared. Despite forming his elite security ring, they didn't fire a shot as US troops entered Caracas. While Cuban defenders died fighting, Russian troops melted away. Russia didn't lose Venezuela in a battle—it walked away without a fight, confirming the fears of many of its allies: when the pressure rises, Moscow will not stand by them.

## Key Implications

- Strategic withdrawal suggests Russia prioritizes avoiding direct confrontation with US forces
- Abandonment of Maduro reveals limits of Russian commitment to allies under pressure
- Contrasts sharply with Cuban forces who remained and fought
- Reinforces concerns among other Russian-aligned nations about reliability of support

## Context

This analysis comes from Euromaidan Press, a Ukraine-focused news outlet, providing perspective on great power dynamics and the viability of Russian security guarantees globally.

## Summary

Comprehensive guide to building AI coding feedback loops specifically for TypeScript projects. Covers essential techniques for maintaining code quality when working with coding agents by implementing type checking, testing, and pre-commit hooks as feedback mechanisms.

## Key Topics

- **Type Checking**: Leveraging TypeScript's type system as a feedback loop for AI agents
- **Testing Strategies**: Using tests as guardrails for AI-generated code
- **Pre-Commit Hooks**: Automated checks before code submission
- **AI Agent Integration**: Techniques for feeding feedback back to coding agents

## Problem Statement

Before implementing these loops: Ralph (coding agent) produces "100% slop"
After implementing: Green CI passes consistently

## Context

Shared by @mattpocockuk as a tutorial for AI coding feedback loops, with emphasis on preventing AI agent code quality issues in TypeScript projects.

# don't waste your back pressure

**Author:** Geoffrey Huntley
**URL:** https://ghuntley.com/pressure/
**Published:** January 17, 2026

## Summary

Geoffrey Huntley discusses a critical insight about AI agent performance: CPU cores are becoming the primary bottleneck, not just model capabilities. The concept of "back pressure" refers to maximizing throughput by getting more "wheel turns per minute" from AI systems. The article references Moss's work on context engineering and structural patterns that enable successful agent applications.

## Key Points

- CPU core limitations are increasingly the bottleneck for AI agent performance
- "Back pressure" is about maximizing throughput and efficiency in AI systems
- Successful agent applications establish structure around agents to maximize their effectiveness
- The article is positioned as "seminal reading for people interested in AI context engineering"
- Focus on getting more iterations and cycles per unit of time

## Context

This article comes from ongoing conversations between Geoffrey Huntley and colleagues about optimizing AI agent performance. It builds on the observation that while model capabilities continue to improve, the practical limitation is often computational resources and system architecture rather than model intelligence.

## Why This Matters

As AI agents become more capable, the engineering challenge shifts from "can the model do this?" to "how can we structure systems to maximize agent throughput?" Understanding back pressure and optimization patterns becomes critical for building production-ready agent systems.

An expanded explanation of Geoffrey's provocative claim that software engineers who haven't adopted AI coding assistants "are not gonna make it" (ngmi). The article frames this as a real employment risk and organizational divide.

The core message: engineering organizations are splitting between those who have had the "oh fuck" moment and embraced AI assistants, and those who haven't. Specifically, developers still using Claude Code in basic y/n mode are falling behind those spinning up 10+ parallel agent instances for complex tasks.

## Key Takeaways

- The adoption of AI coding assistants is now a career-critical skill
- Organizations are divided into AI-native and AI-traditional teams
- Parallel processing with multiple agent instances is becoming the performance baseline
- Traditional prompt-and-wait workflows are increasingly obsolete
- Developers without AI integration skills face genuine employment risk

# everything is a ralph loop

**Author:** Geoffrey Huntley
**URL:** https://ghuntley.com/loop/
**Date:** January 17, 2026

## Summary

Geoffrey Huntley argues that software development has fundamentally shifted from vertical, brick-by-brick building (like Jenga) to an iterative loop-based mindset called the "Ralph Loop." This applies to both forward mode (autonomous building) and reverse mode (clean rooming), representing a different approach to techniques and best practices beyond just AI acceleration.

## Key Points

- Standard software practices build vertically (brick by brick, like Jenga)
- Modern approach treats everything as a loop/cycle
- Ralph Loop encompasses both:
  - Forward mode: autonomous building
  - Reverse mode: clean rooming
- This represents a fundamental shift in mindset, not just tools
- The change is more about approach and techniques than AI capabilities

## Context

This was shared in response to David Fowler's tweet about having an "opus moment" with AI in software engineering, emphasizing that the shift is not just about AI acceleration but about fundamental changes in how we approach building software.

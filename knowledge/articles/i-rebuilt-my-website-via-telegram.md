Dave Kiss used an AI agent (clawdbot) via Telegram to completely rebuild his website from scratch—migrating 18 blog posts from Notion to Astro and moving DNS to Cloudflare—without ever opening his laptop or leaving bed.

## Key Takeaways

- AI agents can now handle complex technical tasks (static site generation, migrations, DNS configuration) through simple chat interfaces
- The capability removes the friction of context-switching and tooling setup—just describe what you need and the agent handles implementation
- Practical demonstration of how AI-assisted development can enable rapid iteration without being physically at a computer

## Why Bookmarked

Exemplary case study of AI agent capability at scale. Shows that agents can handle multi-step technical workflows (content migration, build system setup, infrastructure changes) reliably and autonomously. Relevant for understanding how to architect agent-driven development tools.

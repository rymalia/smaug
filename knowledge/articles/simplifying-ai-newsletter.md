## Overview

Framework for identifying and pursuing your ideal self, based on continuous learning and intentional growth.

## Core Concept

The "Chase" methodology emphasizes:
- Defining the person you aspire to be
- Breaking down aspirational identity into actionable behaviors
- Building communities of learners for mutual growth
- Reducing isolation in the learning and building journey

## Key Principles

**Individual Growth Path:**
- Personal development is an ongoing journey
- Learning should be paired with building
- Growth compounds over time

**Community Support:**
- Learning alone is isolating
- Building together accelerates progress
- Community provides accountability and inspiration
- Shared struggles create stronger bonds

## Community Aspect

The "myfirstdollar" program provides:
- Cohort-based learning
- Peer accountability
- Shared project building
- Regular connection with other learners

## Why This Matters

Many people know intellectually what growth looks like but struggle with:
- Sustained motivation without community
- Translating aspiration into daily actions
- Overcoming isolation in the learning process
- Maintaining momentum through difficult growth phases

This framework addresses the psychological and social dimensions of personal development, not just the tactical.

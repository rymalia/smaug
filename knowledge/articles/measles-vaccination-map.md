## Summary

For the first time, a public interactive map has been created that allows people to enter their ZIP code and see the estimated percentage of their neighbors who have been vaccinated against measles. This tool helps individuals assess the risk level of measles in their specific area based on vaccination coverage data.

## Key Features

- **Interactive map** - Enter ZIP code to see local data
- **Vaccination estimates** - Shows percentage of vaccinated population
- **Risk assessment** - Helps determine measles risk in your area
- **Public access** - Available to general population

## Significance

This represents an important public health tool for transparency and awareness:

- Allows individuals to understand community-level vaccination status
- Supports informed decision-making about health risks
- Provides localized epidemiological data
- Helps identify areas with potentially lower vaccination coverage

## Medical Context

Measles is a highly contagious disease that spreads through respiratory droplets. Community immunity (herd immunity) requires vaccination rates of approximately 95% to prevent transmission. Areas below this threshold face higher risk of outbreaks.

## Summary

A 2-week intervention blocking internet access on smartphones produced significant improvements in mental health, subjective well-being, and sustained attention capacity. 91% of participants improved on at least one measured outcome.

## Key Findings

- **Sustained Attention:** Objectively measured improvements in sustained attention capacity
- **Mental Health:** Overall improvement in mental health metrics
- **Subjective Well-being:** Participants reported higher subjective well-being
- **Success Rate:** 91% of participants showed improvement in at least one outcome

## Mechanism

The mechanism appears straightforward: when internet access was blocked, participants spent more time on alternative activities:
- In-person socializing
- Exercise
- Being in nature

## Research Value

This study provides empirical evidence for the hypothesis that smartphone internet access directly impacts mental health and cognitive focus, and that reducing access can reverse some negative effects even in a short 2-week period.

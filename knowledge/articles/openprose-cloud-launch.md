## Summary

Dan announced the cloud launch of OpenProse, bringing the popular open-source automation skill to cloud infrastructure after strong adoption of the local version.

## What is OpenProse?

OpenProse is a simple, free, open-source skill that enables users to automate complex workflows. Initially available only as a local installation for Claude Code / OpenCode / Amp users, it generated significant user enthusiasm and amazement at how effectively it handles workflow automation.

## Cloud Launch Details

- **Status:** Gradual rollout (not immediately available to all)
- **Infrastructure:** Backed by OpenCode server

## Key Points

- Users reported excellent results for complex workflow automation

- Represents expansion of Claude Code ecosystem tooling

## Context

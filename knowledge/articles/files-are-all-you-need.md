## Summary

Explores the evolving architecture patterns for AI agents, arguing that filesystems are increasingly adequate for many agent use cases instead of traditional databases. Demonstrates how Claude's agent skills feature (markdown directories) provide a simple, shareable alternative to server-based database infrastructure.

## Key Arguments

- **Filesystems vs Databases**: Not a binary choice—match complexity to problem
- **Agent Storage Patterns**: Context, conversation history, and skills increasingly stored as files
- **Claude Skills Feature**: Markdown file directories teach agents new capabilities
- **Advantages of Files**: Simple, shareable, no server overhead, semantic search compatible
- **When Databases Still Win**: Complex queries, structured data, concurrent access requirements

## Relevant Technologies

- Claude agent skills (markdown-based)
- Semantic search on file systems
- LlamaIndex framework
- Agent architecture patterns

## Context

Referenced by Tuana Celik (@tuanacelik) discussing how this architectural shift isn't about superiority but pragmatic complexity matching for AI agent implementations.

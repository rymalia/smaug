Mentoring advice for students and junior developers navigating the AI era. The counterintuitive thesis: junior developers actually have an advantage because they haven't built their identity around a specific programming language or technology stack.

Geoffrey explains that developers who spent years becoming ".NET developers" or "Go developers" face an "identity erasure" when AI makes language-specific expertise less relevant. Juniors without this baggage can adapt more easily to the new AI-driven development paradigm.

## Key Takeaways

- Language-specific developer identity is now a liability, not an asset
- Junior developers avoid the "identity erasure" problem affecting experienced developers
- Students should embrace AI tools and focus on problem-solving over language mastery
- The shift from specialized skills to generalist engineering mindset
- Learning to work effectively with AI coding assistants is now essential

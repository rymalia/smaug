## Summary

A new study finds that relationships characterized by high passion but low intimacy and commitment are associated with higher levels of severe psychological aggression and controlling behaviors compared to companionate partnerships.

## Key Findings

- **High passion + Low intimacy/commitment** = Increased risk of:
  - Severe psychological aggression
  - Controlling behaviors
  - Dysfunctional relationship patterns

- **Companionate relationships** = Lower rates of aggression and control

## Research Implications

This research distinguishes between types of passion in relationships and their psychological outcomes. Relationships driven purely by passion without emotional intimacy or mutual commitment tend toward more unhealthy dynamics.

## Psychological Context

This connects to broader relationship research including:
- Attachment theory
- Emotional intimacy as relationship stabilizer
- The role of commitment in healthy partnerships
- Aggression and control as relationship dysfunction indicators

## Relevance

Important for understanding relationship psychology, domestic conflict prevention, and mental health implications of different relationship structures.

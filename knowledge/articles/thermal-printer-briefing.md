# dev recap: from database optimization to thermal printers

A month of performance improvements, state management migration, and surprisingly fun hardware integration in a GTD todo app.

## Overview

Walter shares his journey building a pre-Claude Code morning briefing agent system that integrates with a thermal printer for physical daily reports. The article covers database optimization, state management, and creative hardware integration.

## Key Features

- Morning briefing automation system
- Thermal printer integration for physical output
- Performance optimization work
- State management improvements
- GTD (Getting Things Done) todo app integration

## Context

This was created before Claude Code/clawdbot became available, demonstrating early experimentation with AI-powered morning routine automation. The thermal printer adds a tangible, physical element to the digital briefing system.

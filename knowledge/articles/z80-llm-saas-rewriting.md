This article demonstrates the Ralph methodology - using LLMs to completely rewrite or clone existing SaaS companies and platforms. The key insight is that you shouldn't just ralph individual features, but entire applications.

Geoffrey Huntley shows how he used Claude Code (Cursor) to:
- Convert C code to Assembly (Z/80)
- Generate specifications from assembly
- Implement a working Z/80 Spectrum tape from scratch

This exemplifies the broader principle that modern LLMs can now handle end-to-end software replication tasks, from one language/architecture to completely different platforms.

## Key Takeaways

- LLMs can now effectively translate across multiple abstraction levels (high-level language → ASM → specs → working implementation)
- Ralph methodology extends beyond code to entire business systems and platforms
- The barrier to cloning and improving existing SaaS has been dramatically lowered
- Live demonstration on YouTube of the /z80 project

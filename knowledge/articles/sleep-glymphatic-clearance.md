# Sleep Physiology and Brain Glymphatic Clearance

## Summary

Eric Topol provides expert commentary on recent glymphatic clearance research, clarifying that deep sleep (not just vasomotion) is critical for clearing brain metabolic waste products. He corrects some misinformation in commonly cited papers.

## Key Points

- **Deep sleep is critical:** For clearance of brain metabolic waste products
- **Beyond vasomotion:** Previous papers on vasomotion-driven glymphatic clearance tell only part of the story
- **Recent research supersedes older findings:** Updated reviews and figures show more complete picture
- **Misleading information exists:** Some frequently cited older papers lack full context

## Research Context

The tweet references:
- A 2020 Cell paper from the team that discovered glymphatic clearance
- Recent Cell Neuron review with updated findings
- Importance of distinguishing between REM sleep, deep sleep, and overall sleep duration

## Original Tweet

> This paper cited below from a year ago (not "new") on vasomotion driving glymphatic clearance is only part of the story, as superseded by this recent review and Figure below https://t.co/nboEJo80ZS
> Deep sleep is critical for clearance of brain metabolic waste products so some information below is misleading.

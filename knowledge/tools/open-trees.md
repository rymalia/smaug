OpenCode plugin for managing git worktrees with ease. This tool enables running parallel agents in separate worktrees, allowing each agent to work independently without interfering with the main branch or each other.

## Key Features

- Fast, safe git worktree workflows integrated into OpenCode
- Enable parallel agent execution with dedicated worktrees
- Worktree mode for toggling tools on/off
- Safe cleanup and pruning of stale worktrees
- Prevents accidental deletion of dirty worktrees
- Swarm mode for creating multiple worktrees in parallel

## Tools

- `worktree_mode` — enable/disable worktree mode and show help
- `worktree_overview` — list, status, or dashboard worktrees
- `worktree_make` — create/open/fork worktrees and sessions
- `worktree_cleanup` — remove or prune worktrees safely

## Why Bookmarked

Essential tool for scaling parallel agent development. Allows multiple autonomous agents to work on different features/branches simultaneously without conflicts, then safely cherry-pick changes back to main.

Modal Examples is a comprehensive collection of demonstration programs showcasing how to build robust and scalable applications using the Modal serverless computing platform.

## Overview

Modal is a cloud platform that allows you to run Python code in the cloud without managing servers. These examples demonstrate Modal's capabilities across various use cases and complexity levels.

## Key Features

- **Getting Started**: Guided introduction from basic hello-world through advanced concepts
- **Serverless Containers**: Spawn cloud containers on-demand for scalable compute
- **GPU Support**: Run machine learning models and heavy computations
- **API Deployment**: Build and deploy web services and APIs
- **Distributed Computing**: Examples of parallel and distributed workflows

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python
- **Topics**: Cloud computing, distributed systems, GPU acceleration, machine learning, serverless architecture, web applications
- **Repository**: modal-labs/modal-examples
- **Stars**: 1,080
- **Organization**: Modal Labs

## Getting Started

1. Sign up for a free account at [modal.com](https://modal.com/)
2. Install the Modal package: `pip install modal`
3. Set your API key
4. Run examples with: `modal run path/to/example.py`

## Example Organization

- **01_getting_started through 14_clusters**: Structured learning path covering Modal concepts
- **misc/**: Additional uncategorized examples
- Tested against Python 3.11+

## Use Cases

- Machine learning model serving
- Batch processing and data pipelines
- Web scraping and content extraction
- Real-time inference and API endpoints
- Distributed computing tasks

## Notes

All examples are continuously tested for correctness and represent production-ready patterns for serverless Python applications.

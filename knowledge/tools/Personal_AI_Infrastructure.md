# Personal AI Infrastructure (PAI)

Personal AI Infrastructure for upgrading humans.

Repository: https://github.com/danielmiessler/Personal_AI_Infrastructure

Language: TypeScript
Topics: ai, augmentation, productivity

A comprehensive personalized AI platform designed to magnify human capabilities. PAI v2.3 includes:

- USER, WORK, and SYSTEM data isolation
- Continuous Learning system based on hook-based sentiment gathering
- User-based skill personalization
- Custom Browser skill (TypeScript CLI-based Playwright MCP alternative)
- 23+ Packs and bundles for different use cases

Key principle: AI should magnify everyone—not just the top 1%. Includes tools for understanding, articulating, and realizing goals using agentic AI.

The system includes specialized features like the PAI Browser Skill - a fast TypeScript CLI tool with Playwright MCP capabilities (20+ tools) that runs without MCP infrastructure.
